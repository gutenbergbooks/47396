<h2 class="no-break">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Shortly after the death of Michael Faraday, Professor
Auguste de la Rive, and others of his friends, gave to the
world their impressions of his life, his character, and his
work; Professor Tyndall drew his portrait as a man of
science; and after a while Dr. Bence Jones published his
biography in two octavo volumes, with copious extracts
from his journals and correspondence. In a review of this
"Life and Letters" I happened to mention my thought
of giving to the public some day my own reminiscences
of the great philosopher; several friends urged me to do
so, not in the pages of a magazine, but in the form of a
little book designed for those of his fellow-countrymen
who venerate his noble character without being able to
follow his scientific researches. I accepted the task.
Professor Tyndall and Dr. Bence Jones, with Messrs.
Longman, the publishers, kindly permitted me to make
free use of their materials; but I am indebted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Corporation of the Trinity House, and to many friends,
for a good deal of additional information; and in compiling
my book I have preferred, where practicable, to
illustrate the character of Faraday by documents or incidents
hitherto unpublished, or contained in those sketches
of the philosopher which are less generally known.</p>

<p>It is due to myself to say that I had pretty well sketched
out the second part of this book before I read M. Dumas'
"Eloge Historique." The close similarity of my analysis
of Professor Faraday's character with that of the illustrious
French chemist may perhaps be accepted as an additional
warrant for the correctness of our independent estimates.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p>The very favourable reception which my book has met
with, both from the press and the public, seems to call
for my grateful acknowledgment on the issue of a
second edition.</p>

<p>In revising the former, I have added some further
particulars about Faraday, especially in regard to "his
method of working;" and an engraving from a photograph
by Watkins, which best recalls to my recollection
the features and the usual expression of the genial
philosopher.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"><!--SECTION I-->
<p class="largefont center spreadletters">MICHAEL FARADAY.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">SECTION I.<br />

<span class="medfont">THE STORY OF HIS LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>At the beginning of this century, in the neighbourhood
of Manchester Square, London, there was an inquisitive
boy running about, playing at marbles, and minding his
baby-sister. He lived in Jacob's Well Mews, close by,
and was learning the three R's at a common day-school.
Few passers-by would have noticed him, and none certainly
would have imagined that this boy, as he grew up, was to
achieve the truest success in life, and to die honoured by
the great, the wise, and the good. Yet so it was; and to
tell the story of his life, to trace the sources of this success,
and to depict some of the noble results of his work, are the
objects of this biographical sketch.</p>

<p>It was not at Jacob's Well Mews, but in Newington Butts,
that the boy had been born, on September 22, 1791, and his
parents, James and Margaret Faraday, had given this, their
third child, the unusual name of Michael. The father was
a journeyman blacksmith, a skilful workman who, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
poverty and feeble health, strove to bring up his children in
habits of industry and the love of God.</p>

<p>Of course young Michael must soon do something for his
living. There happened to be a bookseller's shop in Blandford
Street, a few doors from the entrance to the Mews,
kept by a Mr. Riebau, an intelligent man, who is said to
have had a leaning to astrology; and there he went as errand
boy when thirteen years old. Many a weary walk he had,
carrying round newspapers to his master's customers; but
he did his work faithfully; and so, after a twelvemonth, the
bookseller was willing to take him as an apprentice, and
that without a premium.</p>

<p>Now, a boy in a bookseller's shop can look at the inside
as well as the outside of the books he handles, and young
Faraday took advantage of his position, and fed on such
intellectual food as Watts's "Improvement of the Mind,"
Mrs. Marcet's "Conversations on Chemistry," and the article
on "Electricity" in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, besides such
lighter dishes as Miss Burney's "Evelina;" nor can we doubt
that when he was binding Lyons' "Experiments on Electricity,"
and Boyle's "Notes about the Producibleness of
Chymicall Principles," he looked beyond the covers.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
his thirst for knowledge did not stop with reading: he must
see whether Mrs. Marcet's statements were correct, and so,
to quote his own words, "I made such simple experiments
in chemistry as could be defrayed in their expense by
a few pence per week, and also constructed an electrical
machine, first with a glass phial, and afterwards with a real
cylinder, as well as other electrical apparatus of a corresponding
kind."</p>

<p>He kept too a note-book called "The Philosophical Miscellany,"
intended, he tells us, "to promote both amusement
and instruction, and also to corroborate or invalidate
those theories which are continually starting into the world
of science;" and miscellaneous indeed were the scraps he
gathered from the magazines of the time.</p>

<p>One day, early in 1810, walking somewhere in the neighbourhood
of Fleet Street, he saw in a shop-window a bill
announcing that lectures on natural philosophy were delivered
by Mr. Tatum, at 53, Dorset Street, at eight in the
evening, price of admission one shilling. He wanted to
hear these lectures. His master's permission was obtained,
but where was the money to come from? The needful
shillings were given him by his elder brother, Robert, who
earned them as a blacksmith; and so Michael Faraday
made his first acquaintance with scientific lectures. And not
with lectures only, for Tatum's house was frequented by
other earnest students, and lifelong friendships were formed.
Among these students was Benjamin Abbott, a young Quaker,
who had received a good education, and had then a situation
in a City house as confidential clerk. With him Faraday
chatted on philosophy or anything else, and happily for us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
he chatted on paper, in letters of that fulness and length
which the penny post and the telegraph have well-nigh driven
out of existence; and happily for us, too, Abbott kept those
letters, and Dr. Bence Jones has published them. They are
wonderful letters for a poor bookseller's apprentice; they
bear the stamp of an innate gentleman and philosopher.</p>

<p>Long afterwards, when Benjamin Abbott was an old man,
he used to tell how Faraday made his first experiments in
the kitchen of his house, and delivered his first lecture from
the end of that kitchen table. The electrical machine made
by him in those early days came into the possession of Sir
James South, and now forms one of the treasures of the
Royal Institution.</p>

<p>As the eager student drank in the lectures of Tatum, he
took notes, and he afterwards wrote them out carefully in a
clear hand, numbering and describing the different experiments
that he saw performed, and making wonderfully neat
drawings of the apparatus, in good perspective. These
notes he bound in four volumes, adding to each a copious
index, and prefixing to the first this dedication to his
master:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">To Mr. G. Riebau.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"When first I evinced a predilection for the sciences,
but more particularly for that one denominated electricity,
you kindly interested yourself in the progress I made in the
knowledge of facts relating to the different theories in existence,
readily permitting me to examine those books in your
possession that were in any way related to the subjects then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
occupying my attention. To you, therefore, is to be attributed
the rise and existence of that small portion of knowledge
relating to the science which I possess, and accordingly
to you are due my acknowledgments.</p>

<p>"Unused to the arts of flattery, I can only express my
obligations in a plain but sincere way. Permit me, therefore,
Sir, to return thanks in this manner for the many
favours I have received at your hands and by your means
and believe me,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Your grateful and obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now there happened to be lodging at Mr. Riebau's a
notable foreigner of the name of Masquerier. He was a
distinguished artist, who had painted Napoleon's portrait,
and had passed through the stirring events of the first
French Revolution, not without serious personal danger,
and was now finding a refuge and a home in London. He
was struck with the intelligence of the apprentice, whose
duty it was to do various offices for him; and he lent the
young man his books, and taught him how to make the
drawings in perspective which have already been alluded to.</p>

<p>But the lectures in Dorset Street were not the only ones
that Michael Faraday attended; and as the Royal Institution
is the central scene of all his subsequent history, we
must pay a mental visit to that building. Turning from the
busy stream of Piccadilly into the quiet of Albemarle
Street, we see, in a line with the other houses, a large
Grecian façade with fourteen lofty pilasters. Between these
are folding doors, which are pushed open from time to time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by grave-looking gentlemen, many of them white-headed;
but often of an afternoon, and always on Friday evening
during the season, the quiet street is thronged with carriages
and pedestrians, ladies and gentlemen, who flock through
these folding doors. Entering with them, we find ourselves
in a vestibule, with a large stone staircase in front, and rooms
opening on the right and left. The walls of these rooms
are lined with myriads of books, and the tables are covered
with scientific and other periodicals of the day, and there
are cabinets of philosophical apparatus and a small museum.
Going up the broad staircase and turning to the right, we
pass through an ante-room to the lecture theatre. There
stands the large table, horseshoe-shaped, with the necessary
appliances for experiments, and behind it a furnace and
arrangements for black-board and diagrams; while round
the table as a centre range semicircular seats, rising tier
above tier, and surmounted by a semicircular gallery, the
whole capable of seating 700 persons. On the basement
is a new chemical laboratory, fitted up with modern appliances,
and beyond it the old laboratory, with its furnaces
and sand-bath, its working tables and well-stored shelves,
flanked by cellars that look like dark lumber-rooms. A
narrow private staircase leads up to the suite of apartments
in which resides the Director of the house. Such is the
Royal Institution of Great Britain, incorporated by Royal
Charter in the year 1800, "for the diffusing knowledge and
facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical inventions
and improvements, and for teaching, by courses of
philosophical lectures and experiments, the application of
science to the common purposes of life;"&mdash;with the motto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
"Illustrans commoda vitæ." Fifty or sixty years ago the
building was essentially what it is now, except the façade
and entrance, and that the laboratory, which was considered
a model of perfection, was even darker than at present, and
in the place of the modern chemical room there was a
small theatre. The side room, too, was fitted up for actual
work, though even at mid-day it had to be artificially
lighted; and beyond this there was, and still is, a place
called the Froggery, from a certain old tradition of frogs
having been kept there. The first intention of the founders
to exhibit useful inventions had not been found very practicable,
but the place was already famous with the memories
of Rumford and Young; and at that time the genius of Sir
Humphry Davy was entrancing the intellectual world with
brilliant discoveries, and drawing fashionable audiences to
Albemarle Street to listen to his eloquent expositions.</p>

<p>Among the customers of the bookseller in Blandford
Street was a Mr. Dance, who, being a member of the Royal
Institution, took young Faraday to hear the last four public
lectures of Davy. The eager student sat in the gallery, just
over the clock, and took copious notes of the Professor's
explanations of radiant matter, chlorine, simple inflammables,
and metals, while he watched the experiments that
were performed. Afterwards he wrote the lectures fairly out
in a quarto volume, that is still preserved&mdash;first the theoretical
portions, then the experiments with drawings, and
finally an index. "The desire to be engaged in scientific
occupation, even though of the lowest kind, induced me,"
he says, "whilst an apprentice, to write, in my ignorance of
the world and simplicity of my mind, to Sir Joseph Banks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
then President of the Royal Society. Naturally enough,
'No answer' was the reply left with the porter."</p>

<p>On the 7th of October his apprenticeship expired, and on
the next day he became a journeyman bookbinder under a
disagreeable master&mdash;who, like his friend the artist, was a
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émigré</i>. No wonder he sighed still more for congenial
occupation.</p>

<p>Towards the end of that same October Sir Humphry
Davy was working on a new liquid which was violently explosive,
now known as chloride of nitrogen,&mdash;and he met
with an accident that seriously injured his eye, and produced
an attack of inflammation. Of course, for a while he could
not write, and, possibly through the introduction of M.
Masquerier,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the young bookseller was employed as his
amanuensis. This, however, Faraday himself tells us lasted
only "some days;" and in writing years afterwards to Dr.
Paris, he says, "My desire to escape from trade, which I
thought vicious and selfish, and to enter into the service of
Science, which I imagined made its pursuers amiable and
liberal, induced me at last to take the bold and simple
step of writing to Sir H. Davy, expressing my wishes, and
a hope that, if an opportunity came in his way, he would
favour my views; at the same time I sent the notes I had
taken of his lectures." Davy, it seems, called with the
letter on one of his friends&mdash;at that time honorary inspector
of the models and apparatus&mdash;and said, "Pepys, what am I
to do? Here is a letter from a young man named Faraday;
he has been attending my lectures, and wants me to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
him employment at the Royal Institution&mdash;<em>what can I do?</em>"
"Do?" replied Pepys; "put him to wash bottles: if he is
good for anything, he will do it directly; if he refuses, he is
good for nothing." "No, no," replied Davy, "we must try
him with something better than that."</p>

<p>So Davy wrote a kind reply, and had an interview with the
young man upon the subject; in which, however, he advised
him to stick to his business, telling him that "Science was a
harsh mistress, and, in a pecuniary point of view, but poorly
rewarding those who devoted themselves to her service."
He promised him the work of the Institution, and his own
besides.</p>

<p>But shortly afterwards the laboratory assistant was discharged
for misconduct, and so it happened that one night
the inhabitants of quiet Weymouth Street were startled by
the unusual apparition of a grand carriage with a footman,
which drew up before the house where Faraday lived, when
the servant left a note from Sir Humphry Davy. The next
morning there was an interview, which resulted in the young
aspirant for scientific work being engaged to help the famous
philosopher. His engagement dates from March 1, 1813, and
he was to get 25<em>s.</em> per week, and a room in the house. The
duties had been previously laid down by the managers:&mdash;"To
attend and assist the lecturers and professors in preparing
for, and during lectures. Where any instruments or apparatus
may be required, to attend to their careful removal from the
model room and laboratory to the lecture-room, and to clean
and replace them after being used; reporting to the managers
such accidents as shall require repair, a constant diary
being kept by him for that purpose. That in one day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
each week he be employed in keeping clean the models in
the repository, and that all the instruments in the glass cases
be cleaned and dusted at least once within a month."</p>

<p>The young assistant did not confine himself to the mere
discharge of these somewhat menial duties. He put in
order the mineralogical collection; and from the first we
find him occupying a higher position than the minute quoted
above would indicate.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days he was extracting sugar from
beet-root; but all his laboratory proceedings were not so
pleasant or so innocent as that, for he had to make one
of the worst smelling of all chemical compounds, bisulphide
of carbon; and as Davy continued to work on the explosive
chloride of nitrogen, his assistant's career stood some chance
of being suddenly cut short at its commencement. Indeed
it seems that before the middle of April he had run the
gauntlet of four separate explosions. Knowing that the
liquid would go off on the slightest provocation, the experimenters
wore masks of glass, but this did not save them
from injury. In one case Faraday was holding a small tube
containing a few grains of it between his finger and thumb,
and brought a piece of warm cement near it, when he was
suddenly stunned, and on returning to consciousness found
himself standing with his hand in the same position, but
torn by the shattered tube, and the glass of his mask even
cut by the projected fragments. Nor was it easy to say
when the compound could be relied on, for it seemed very
capricious; for instance, one day it rose quietly in vapour in
a tube exhausted by the air-pump, but the next day, when
subjected to the same treatment, it exploded with a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
noise, and Sir Humphry was cut about the chin, and was
struck with violence on the forehead. This seems to have
put an end to the experiments.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of disagreeables and dangers, the
embryo philosopher worked on with a joyful heart, beguiling
himself occasionally with a song, and in the evening playing
tunes on his flute.</p>

<p>The change in Michael Faraday's employment naturally
made him more earnest still in the pursuit of knowledge.
He was admitted as a member of the "City Philosophical
Society," a fraternity of thirty or forty men in the middle
or lower ranks of life, who met every Wednesday evening
for mutual instruction; and here is a contemporary picture
of him at one of its debates:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Another way in which he strove to educate himself is
thus described in his own words:&mdash;"During this spring
Magrath and I established the mutual improvement plan,
and met at my rooms up in the attics of the Royal Institution,
or at Wood Street at his warehouse. It consisted,
perhaps, of half-a-dozen persons, chiefly from the City
Philosophical Society, who met of an evening to read
together, and to criticise, correct, and improve each other's
pronunciation and construction of language. The discipline
was very sturdy, the remarks very plain and open,
and the results most valuable. This continued for several
years."</p>

<p>Seven months after his appointment there began a new
passage in Faraday's life, which gave a fresh impulse to his
mental activity, and largely extended his knowledge of men
and things. Sir Humphry Davy, wishing to travel on the
Continent, and having received a special pass from the
Emperor Napoleon, offered to take him as his amanuensis:
he accepted the proposal, and for a year and a half they
wandered about France, Italy, and Switzerland, and then
they returned rapidly by the Tyrol, Germany, and Holland.</p>

<p>From letters written when abroad we can catch some of
the impressions made on his mind by these novel scenes.
"I have not forgot," he writes to Abbott, "and never shall
forget, the ideas that were forced on my mind in the first
days. To me, who had lived all my days of remembrance
in London, a city surrounded by a flat green country, a hill
was a mountain, and a stone a rock; for though I had abstract
ideas of the things, and could say rock and mountain,
and would talk of them, yet I had no perfect ideas. Conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
then the astonishment, the pleasure, and the information
which entered my mind in the varied county of Devonshire,
where the foundations of the earth were first exposed
to my view, and where I first saw granite, limestone, &amp;c., in
those places and in those forms where the ever-working and
all-wonderful hand of nature had placed them. Mr. Ben.,
it is impossible you can conceive my feelings, and it is as
impossible for me to describe them. The sea then presented
a new source of information and interest; and on
approaching the shores of France, with what eagerness, and
how often, were my eyes directed to the South! When
arrived there, I thought myself in an uncivilized country; for
never before nor since have I seen such wretched beings as
at Morlaix." His impression of the people was not improved
by the fact of their having arrested the travellers
on landing, and having detained them for five days until
they had sent to Paris for verification of their papers.</p>

<p>Again, to her towards whom his heart was wont to turn
from distant lands with no small longing: "I have said
nothing as yet to you, dear mother, about our past journey,
which has been as pleasant and agreeable (a few things
excepted, in reality nothing) as it was possible to be. Sir
H. Davy's high name at Paris gave us free admission into
all parts of the French dominions, and our passports were
granted with the utmost readiness. We first went to Paris,
and stopped there two months; afterwards we passed, in
a southerly direction, through France to Montpellier, on the
borders of the Mediterranean. From thence we went to
Nice, stopping a day or two at Aix on our way; and from
Nice we crossed the Alps to Turin, in Piedmont. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Turin we proceeded to Genoa, which place we left afterwards
in an open boat, and proceeded by sea towards Lerici.
This place we reached after a very disagreeable passage,
and not without apprehensions of being overset by the way.
As there was nothing there very enticing, we continued our
route to Florence; and, after a stay of three weeks or a
month, left that fine city, and in four days arrived here at
Rome. Being now in the midst of things curious and interesting,
something arises every day which calls for attention
and observations. The relics of ancient Roman magnificence,
the grandeur of the churches, and their richness
also&mdash;the difference of habits and customs, each in turn
engages the mind, and keeps it continually employed.
Florence, too, was not destitute of its attractions for me,
and in the Academy del Cimento and the museum attached
to it is contained an inexhaustible fund of entertainment
and improvement; indeed, during the whole journey, new
and instructive things have been continually presented to
me. Tell B. I have crossed the Alps and the Apennines;
I have been at the Jardin des Plantes; at the museum
arranged by Buffon; at the Louvre, among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i>
of sculpture and the masterpieces of painting; at the
Luxembourg Palace, amongst Rubens' works; that I have
seen a <span class="smcap">Glowworm</span>!!! waterspouts, torpedo, the museum at
the Academy del Cimento, as well as St. Peter's, and some
of the antiquities here, and a vast variety of things far too
numerous to enumerate."</p>

<p>But he kept a lengthy journal, and as we turn over the
pages&mdash;for the best part of it is printed by Bence Jones&mdash;we
meet vivid sketches of the provokingly slow custom-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
officers, the postilion in jack-boots, and the thin pigs of
Morlaix&mdash;pictures of Paris, too, when every Frenchman was
to him an unintelligible enemy; when the Apollo Belvidere,
the Venus de Medici, and the Dying Gladiator were at the
Louvre, and when the First Napoleon visited the Senate in
full state. "He was sitting in one corner of his carriage,
covered and almost hidden from sight by an enormous robe
of ermine, and his face overshadowed by a tremendous
plume of feathers that descended from a velvet hat." We
watch Sir Humphry as Ampère and others bring to him the
first specimens of iodine, and he makes experiments with
his travelling apparatus on the dark lustrous crystals and
their violet vapour; we seem, too, to be present with the
great English chemist and his scholar as they burn diamonds
at Florence by means of the Grand Duke's gigantic lens,
and prove that the invisible result is carbonic acid; or as
they study the springs of inflammable gas at Pietra Mala,
and the molten minerals of Vesuvius. The whole, too, is
interspersed with bits of fun, and this culminates at the
Roman Carnival, where he evidently thoroughly enjoyed the
follies of the Corso, the pelting with sugar-plums, and the
masked balls, to the last of which he went in a nightgown
and nightcap, with a lady who knew all his acquaintances;
and between the two they puzzled their friends mightily.</p>

<p>This year and a half may be considered as the time of
Faraday's education; it was the period of his life that best
corresponds with the collegiate course of other men who
have attained high distinction in the world of thought. But
his University was Europe; his professors the master whom
he served, and those illustrious men to whom the renown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Davy introduced the travellers. It made him personally
known, also, to foreign <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i>, at a time when there was
little intercourse between Great Britain and the Continent;
and thus he was associated with the French Academy of
Sciences while still young, his works found a welcome all
over Europe, and some of the best representatives of foreign
science became his most intimate friends.</p>

<p>In May 1815, his engagement at the Royal Institution
was renewed, with a somewhat higher position and increased
salary, which was again raised in the following year to 100<em>l.</em>
per annum. The handwriting in the Laboratory Note-book
changes in September 1815, from the large running letters
of Brande to the small neat characters of Faraday, his first
entry having reference to an analysis of "Dutch turf ash,"
and then soon occur investigations into the nature of substances
bearing what must have been to him the mysterious
names of Paligenetic tincture, and <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Baphe eugenes chruson</i>.
It is to be hoped that the constituents of this golden dye
agreed together better than the Greek words of its name.</p>

<p>We can imagine the young philosopher taking a deeper
interest in the researches on flame which his master was then
carrying out, and in the gradual perfection of the safety-lamp
that was to bid defiance to the explosive gases of the mine;
this at least is certain, that Davy, in the preface to his celebrated
paper on the subject, expresses himself "indebted to
Mr. Michael Faraday for much able assistance," and that
the youthful investigator carefully preserved the manuscript
given him to copy.</p>

<p>Part of his duty, in fact, was to copy such papers; and
as Sir Humphry had a habit of destroying them, he begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
leave to keep the originals, and in that way collected two
large volumes of precious manuscripts.</p>

<p>But there came a change. Hitherto he had been absorbing;
now he was to emit. The knowledge which had been
a source of delight to himself must now overflow as a blessing
to others: and this in two ways. His first lecture was
given at the City Philosophical Society on January 17, 1816,
and in the same year his first paper was published in the
<cite>Quarterly Journal of Science</cite>. The lecture was on the general
properties of matter; the paper was an analysis of some
native caustic lime from Tuscany. Neither was important
in itself, but each resembled those little streams which
travellers are taken to look at because they are the sources
of mighty rivers, for Faraday became the prince of experimental
lecturers, and his long series of published researches
have won for him the highest niche in the temple of science.</p>

<p>When he began to investigate for himself, it could not
have been easy to separate his own work from that which
he was expected to do for his master. Hence no small
danger of misunderstandings and jealousies; and some of
these ugly attendants on rising fame did actually throw their
black shadows over the intercourse between the older and
the younger man of genius. In these earlier years, however,
all appears to have been bright; and the following
letter, written from Rome in October 1818, will give a good
idea of the assistant's miscellaneous duties, and of the
pleasant feelings of Davy towards him. It may be added
that in another letter he is requested to send some dozens
of "flies with pale bodies" to Florence, for Sir Humphry
loved fly-fishing as well as philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">"To Mr. Faraday.</span></p>

<p>"I received the note you were so good as to address to
me at Venice; and by a letter from Mr. Hatchett I find
that you have found the parallax of Mr. West's Sirius, and
that, as I expected, he is mistaken.</p>

<p>"If when you write to me you will give the 3 per cents.
and <em>long annuities</em>, it will be enough.</p>

<p>"I will thank you to put the enclosed letters into the
post, except those for Messrs. Morland and Messrs. Drummond,
which perhaps you will be good enough to deliver.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hatchett's letter contained praises of you which
were very gratifying to me; and pray believe me there is no
one more interested in your success and welfare than your
sincere well-wisher and friend,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">H. Davy.</span></p>

<p class="leftalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">Rome.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that he had any astronomical
duties, for the parallax he had found was not that
of the Dog-star, but of a reputed new metal, Sirium, which
was resolved in Faraday's hands into iron, nickel, and sulphur.
But the impostor was not to be put down so easily,
for he turned up again under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alias</i> of Vestium; but
again he was unable to escape the vigilant eye of the young
detective, for one known substance after another was removed
from it; and then, says Faraday, "my Vestium
entirely disappeared."</p>

<p>His occupations during this period were multifarious
enough. We must picture him to ourselves as a young-looking
man of about thirty years of age, well made, and neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in his dress, his cheerfulness of disposition often breaking
out in a short crispy laugh, but thoughtful enough when
something important is to be done. He has to prepare the
apparatus for Brande's lectures, and when the hour has arrived
he stands on the right of the Professor, and helps him
to produce the strange transformations of the chemical art.
And conjurers, indeed, the two appear in the eyes of the
youth on the left, who waits upon them, then the "laboratory
assistant," now the well-known author, Mr. William
Bollaert, from whom I have learnt many details of this period.
When not engaged with the lectures, Faraday is manufacturing
rare chemicals, or performing commercial analyses,
or giving scientific evidence on trials. One of these was a
famous one, arising from the Imperial Insurance Company
resisting the claim of Severn and King, sugar-bakers; and
in it appeared all the chemists of the day, like knights in
the lists, on opposite sides, ready to break a lance with
each other.</p>

<p>All his spare time Faraday was occupied with original
work. Chlorine had a fascination for him, though the yellow
choking gas would get out into the room, and he investigated
its combinations with carbon, squeezed it into a
liquid, and applied it successfully as a disinfectant when
fatal fever broke out in the Millbank Penitentiary. Iodine
too, another of Davy's elements, was made to join itself to
carbon and hydrogen; and naphthaline was tormented with
strong mineral acids. Long, too, he tried to harden steel
and prevent its rusting, by alloying it with small quantities
of platinum and the rarer metals; the boy blew the bellows
till the crucibles melted, but a few ordinary razors seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
have been the best results. Far more successful was he in
repeating and extending some experiments of Ampère on
the mutual action of magnets and electric currents; and
when, after months of work and many ingenious contrivances,
the wire began to move round the magnet, and the
magnet round the wire, he himself danced about the revolving
metals, his face beaming with joy&mdash;a joy not unmixed
with thankful pride&mdash;as he exclaimed, "There they go!
there they go! we have succeeded at last." After this discovery
he thought himself entitled to a treat, and proposed
to his attendant a visit to the theatre. "Which shall it
be?" "Oh, let it be Astley's, to see the horses." So to
Astley's they went; but at the pit entrance there was
a crush; a big fellow pressed roughly upon the lad, and
Faraday, who could stand no injustice, ordered him to
behave himself, and showed fight in defence of his young
companion.</p>

<p>The rising philosopher indulged, too, in other recreations.
He had a wonderful velocipede, a progenitor of the modern
bicycle, which often took him of an early morning to Hampstead
Hill. There was also his flute; and a small party for
the practice of vocal music once a week at a friend's house.
He sang bass correctly, both as to time and tune.</p>

<p>And though the City Philosophical Society was no more,
the ardent group of students of nature who used to meet
there were not wholly dispersed. They seem to have carried
on their system of mutual improvement, and to have
read the current scientific journals at Mr. Nicol's house till
he married, and then alternately at those of Mr. R. H.
Solly, Mr. Ainger, and Mr. Hennel, of Apothecaries' Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
who came to a tragical end through an explosion of fulminating
silver. Several of them, including Mr. Cornelius
Varley, joined the Society of Arts, which at that time had
committees of various sciences, and was very democratic in
its management; and, finding that by pulling together they
had great influence, they constituted themselves a "caucus,"
adopting the American word, and meeting in private.
Magrath was looked upon as a "chair-maker," and Faraday
in subsequent years held the office of Chairman of the
Committee of Chemistry, and occasionally he presided at
the large meetings of the Society.</p>

<p>During this time (1823) the Athenæum Club was started,
not in the present Grecian palace in Pall Mall, but in a private
house in Waterloo Place. Its members were the aristocracy
of science, literature, and art, and they made Faraday
their honorary secretary; but after a year he transferred the
office to his friend Magrath, who held it for a long period.</p>

<p>Among the various sects into which Christendom is
divided, few are less known than the Sandemanians. About
a century and a half ago, when there was little light in the
Presbyterian Church of Scotland, a pious minister of the
name of John Glas began to preach that the Church should
be governed only by the teaching of Christ and His apostles,
that its connection with the State was an error, and that we
ought to believe and to practise no more and no less than
what we find from the New Testament that the primitive
Church believed and practised. These principles, which
sound very familiar in these days, procured for their asserter
much obloquy and a deposition by the Church Courts, in
consequence of which several separate congregations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
formed in different parts of Great Britain, especially by
Robert Sandeman, the son-in-law of Mr. Glas, and from
him they received their common appellation. In early
days they taught a simpler view of faith than was generally
held at that time; it was with them a simple assent of
the understanding, but produced by the Spirit of God,
and its virtue depended not on anything mystical in the
operation itself, but on the grandeur and beauty of the
things believed. Now, however, there is little to distinguish
them in doctrine from other adherents of the Puritan
theology, though they certainly concede a greater deference
to their elders, and attach more importance to the Lord's
Supper than is usual among the Puritan Churches. Their
form of worship, too, resembles that of the Presbyterians;
but they hold that each congregation should have a plurality
of elders, pastors, or bishops, who are unpaid men; that on
every "first day of the week" they are bound to assemble,
not only for prayers and preaching, but also for "breaking
of bread," and putting together their weekly offerings; that
the love-feast and kiss of charity should continue to be
practised; that "blood and things strangled" are still forbidden
as food; and that a disciple of Christ should not
charge interest on loans except in the case of purely business
transactions, or lay up wealth for the unknown future,
but rather consider all he possesses as at the service of his
poorer brethren, and be ready to perform to them such
offices of kindness as in the early Church were expressed by
washing one another's feet.</p>

<p>But what gives the remarkable character to the adherents
of this sect is their perfect isolation from all Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fellowship outside their own community, and from all
external religious influence. They have never made missionary
efforts to win men from the world, and have long
ceased to draw to themselves members from other Churches;
so they have rarely the advantage of fresh blood, or fresh
views of the meaning of Scripture. They commonly intermarry,
and are expected to "bear one another's burthens;"
so the Church has acquired somewhat of the additional
character of a large intertwined family and of a mutual
benefit society. This rigid separation from the world,
extending now through three or four generations, has produced
a remarkable elevation of moral tone and refinement
of manner; and it is said that no one unacquainted with
the inner circle can conceive of the brotherly affection that
reigns there, or the extent to which hospitality and material
help is given without any ostentation, and received without
any loss of self-respect. The body is rendered still more
seclusive by demanding, not merely unity of spirit among
its members, but unanimity of opinion in every Church
transaction. In order to secure this, any dissentient who
persists in his opinion after repeated argument is rejected;
the same is also the consequence of neglect of Church
duties, as well as of any grave moral offence: and in such
a community excommunication is a serious social ban, and
though a penitent may be received back once, he can never
return a second time.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this little community that Faraday
received his earliest religious impressions, and among them
he found his ecclesiastical home till the day of his entrance
into the Church above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the elders of the Sandemanian Church in London
was Mr. Barnard, a silversmith, of Paternoster Row. The
young philosopher became a visitor at his house, and though
he had previously written,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"What is't that comes in false deceitful guise,</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">Making dull fools of those that 'fore were wise?</div>
<div class="verse indent12">'Tis Love."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&mdash;he altered his opinion in the presence of the citizen's third
daughter, Sarah, and wrote to her what was certainly not
the letter of a fool:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know me as well or better than I do myself. You
know my former prejudices and my present thoughts&mdash;you
know my weaknesses, my vanity, my whole mind; you have
converted me from one erroneous way, let me hope you will
attempt to correct what others are wrong.... Again
and again I attempt to say what I feel, but I cannot.
Let me, however, claim not to be the selfish being that
wishes to bend your affections for his own sake only. In
whatever way I can best minister to your happiness, either
by assiduity or by absence, it shall be done. Do not injure
me by withdrawing your friendship, or punish me for aiming
to be more than a friend by making me less; and if you
cannot grant me more, leave me what I possess,&mdash;but
hear me."</p>

<p>The lady hesitated, and went to Margate. There he
followed her, and they proceeded together to Dover and
Shakspeare's Cliff, and he returned to London full of happiness
and hope. He loved her with all the ardour of his
nature, and in due course, on June 12, 1821, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
married. The bridegroom desired that there should be no
bustle or noise at the wedding, and that the day should not
be specially distinguished; but he calls it himself "an event
which more than any other contributed to his happiness and
healthful state of mind." As years rolled on the affection
between husband and wife became only deeper and deeper;
his bearing towards her proved it, and his letters frequently
testify to it. Doubtless at any time between their marriage
and his final illness he might have written to her as he did
from Birmingham, at the time of the British Association:&mdash;"After
all, there is no pleasure like the tranquil pleasures of
home, and here&mdash;even here&mdash;the moment I leave the table,
I wish I were with you <span class="smcap">in quiet</span>. Oh! what happiness is
ours! My runs into the world in this way only serve to
make me esteem that happiness the more."</p>

<p>He took his bride home to Albemarle Street, and there
they spent their wedded life; but until Mr. Barnard's death
it was their custom to go every Saturday to the house of the
worthy silversmith, and spend Sunday with him, returning
home usually in the evening of that day. His own father
died while he was at Riebau's, but his mother, a grand-looking
woman, lived long afterwards, supported by her
son, whom she occasionally visited at the Institution, and
of whose growing reputation she was not a little proud.</p>

<p>With a mind calmed and strengthened by this beautiful
domestic life, he continued with greater and greater enthusiasm
to ask questions of Nature, and to interpret her replies
to his fellow-men. Just before his marriage he had
been appointed at the Royal Institution superintendent of
the house and laboratory, and in February 1825, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
change in the management of the Institution, he was placed
as director in a position of greater responsibility and influence.
One of his first acts in this capacity was to invite
the members to a scientific evening in the laboratory; this
took place three or four times in 1825, and in the following
years these gatherings were held every week from Feb. 3
to June 9; and though the labour devolved very much
upon Faraday, other philosophers sometimes brought forward
discoveries or useful inventions. Thus commenced
those Friday evening meetings which have done so much to
popularize the high achievements of science. Faraday's
note-books are still preserved, containing the minutes of the
committee-meetings every Thursday afternoon, the Duke of
Somerset chairman, and he secretary; also the record of the
Friday evenings themselves, who lectured, and on what subject,
and what was exhibited in the library, till June 1840,
when other arrangements were probably made.</p>

<p>The year 1827 was otherwise fruitful in lectures: in the
spring, a course of twelve on chemical manipulation at the
London Institution; after Easter, his first course at Albemarle
Street, six lectures on chemical philosophy (he had
helped Professor Brande in 1824);<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and at Christmas, his
desire to convey knowledge, and his love to children, found
expression in a course of six lectures to the boys and
girls home for their holidays. These were a great success;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
indeed, he himself says they "were just what they ought to
have been, both in matter and manner,&mdash;but it would not
answer to give an extended course in the same spirit." He
continued these juvenile lectures during nineteen years.
The notes for courses of lectures were written in school
copy-books, and sometimes he appends a general remark
about the course, not always so favourable as the one given
above. Thus he writes, "The eight lectures on the operations
of the laboratory, April 1828, were not to my mind."
Of the course of twelve in the spring of 1827, he says he
"found matter enough in the notes for at least seventeen."</p>

<p>Up to 1833 Faraday was bringing the forces of nature in
subjection to man on a salary of only 100<em>l.</em> per annum,
with house, coals, and candles, as the funds of the Institution
would not at that time afford more; but among the
sedate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitúes</i> of the place was a tall, jovial gentleman, who
lounged to the lectures in his old-fashioned blue coat and
brass buttons, grey smalls, and white stockings, who was a
munificent friend in need. This was John Fuller, a member
of Parliament. He founded a Professorship of Chemistry
with an endowment that brings in nearly 100<em>l.</em> a year, and
gave the first appointment to Faraday for life. When the
Institution became richer, his income was increased; and
when, on account of the infirmities of age, he could no
longer investigate, lecture, or keep accounts, the managers
insisted on his still retaining in name his official connection
with the place, with his salary and his residence there. Nor
indeed could they well have acted otherwise; for though
the Royal Institution afforded in the first instance a congenial
soil for the budding powers of Faraday, his growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
soon became its strength; and eventually the blooming of
his genius, and the fruit it bore, were the ornament and
glory of the Institution.</p>

<p>It will be asked, Was this 100<em>l.</em> or 200<em>l.</em> per annum the
sole income of Faraday? No; in early days he did commercial
analyses, and other professional work, which paid
far better than pure science. In 1830 his gains from this
source amounted to 1,000<em>l.</em>, and in 1831 to considerably
more; they might easily have been increased, but at that
time he made one of his most remarkable discoveries&mdash;the
evolution of electricity from magnetism,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;and there seemed
to lie open before him the solution of the problem how to
make one force exhibit at will the phenomena of magnetism
or of common or voltaic electricity. And then he had to
face another problem&mdash;his own mental force might be turned
either to the acquisition of a fortune, or to the following up
of those great discoveries; it would not do both: which
should he relinquish? The choice was deliberately made:
Nature revealed to him more and more of her secrets, but
his professional gains sank in 1832 to 155<em>l.</em> 9<em>s.</em>, and during
no subsequent year did they amount even to that.</p>

<p>Still his work was not entirely confined to his favourite
studies. In a letter to Lord Auckland, long afterwards, he
says:&mdash;"I have given up, for the last ten years or more, all
professional occupation, and voluntarily resigned a large
income that I might pursue in some degree my own objects
of research. But in doing this I have always, as a good
subject, held myself ready to assist the Government if still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in my power, <em>not for pay</em>; for, except in one instance (and
then only for the sake of the person joined with me), I
refused to take it. I have the honour and pleasure of
applications, and that very recently, from the Admiralty,
the Ordnance, the Home Office, the Woods and Forests,
and other departments, all of which I have replied to, and
will reply to as long as strength is left me." He had
declined the Professorship of Chemistry at the London
University&mdash;now University College,&mdash;but in 1829 he accepted
a lectureship at the Royal Academy, Woolwich,
and held it for about twenty years. In 1836 he became
scientific adviser to the Trinity House, and his letter to the
Deputy Master also shows his feelings in reference to such
employment:&mdash;"You have left the title and the sum in
pencil. These I look at mainly as regards the character
of the appointment; you will believe me to be sincere in
this, when you remember my indifference to your proposition
as a matter of interest, though <em>not as a matter of kindness</em>.
In consequence of the goodwill and confidence of all
around me, I can at any moment convert my time into
money, but I do not require more of the latter than is sufficient
for necessary purposes. The sum, therefore, of 200<em>l.</em>
is quite enough in itself, but not if it is to be the indicator
of the character of the appointment; but I think you do
not view it so, and that you and I understand each other in
that respect; and your letter confirms me in that opinion.
The position which I presume you would wish me to hold
is analogous to that of a standing counsel." For nearly
thirty years Faraday continued to report on all scientific
suggestions and inventions connected with lighthouses or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
buoys, not for personal gain or renown, but for the public
good. His position was never above that of a "standing
counsel." In his own words: "I do not know the exact
relation of the Board of Trade and the Trinity House to
each other; I am simply an adviser upon philosophical
questions, and am put into action only when called upon."</p>

<p>In regard to the lectureship at Woolwich, Mr. Abel, his
successor, writes thus:&mdash;"Faraday appears to have enjoyed
his weekly trips to Woolwich, which he continued for so
many years, as a source of relaxation. He was in the habit
of going to Woolwich in the afternoon or evening preceding
his lecture at the Military Academy, then preparing
at once for his experiments, and afterwards generally taking
a country ramble. The lecture was delivered early the following
morning. No man was so respected, admired, and
beloved as a teacher at the Military Academy in former
days as Faraday. Many are the little incidents which have
been communicated to me by his pupils illustrative of his
charms as a lecturer, and of his kindly feelings for the
youths to whom he endeavoured to impart a taste for, if not
a knowledge of, science. But for some not ill-meant, though
scarcely judicious, proposal to dictate modifications in his
course of instruction, Faraday would probably have continued
for some years longer to lecture at Woolwich. In
May 1852, soon after I had been appointed his successor,
Faraday wrote to me requesting the return of some tubes
of condensed gases which he left at the Academy. This
letter ends thus:&mdash;'I hope you feel yourself happy and
comfortable in your arrangements at the Academy, and have
cause to be pleased with the change. I was ever very kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
received there, and that portion of regret which one must
ever feel in concluding a long engagement would be in some
degree lessened with me by hearing that you had reason to
be satisfied with your duties and their acceptance.&mdash;Ever
very truly yours, <span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>.'"</p>

<p>For year after year the life of Faraday afforded no adventure
and little variety, only an ever-growing skill in his
favourite pursuit, higher and higher success, and ever-widening
fame. But simple as were his mind and his
habits, no one picture can present him as the complete man;
we must try to make sketches from various points of view,
and leave it to the reader's imagination to combine them.</p>

<p>Let us watch him on an ordinary day. After eight hours'
sleep, he rises in time to breakfast at eight o'clock, goes
round the Institution to see that all is in order, and descends
into the laboratory, puts on a large white apron, the stains
and holes in which tell of previous service, and is busy
among his pieces of apparatus. The faithful Anderson, an
old soldier, who always did exactly what he was told, and
nothing more,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is waiting upon him; and as thought flashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
after thought through his eager&mdash;perhaps impatient&mdash;brain,
he twists his wires into new shapes, and re-arranges his
magnets and batteries. Then some conclusion is arrived at
which lights up his face with a gleam of satisfaction, but the
next minute a doubt comes across that expressive brow&mdash;may
the results not be due to something else yet imperfectly
conceived?&mdash;and a new experiment must be devised to
answer that. In the meantime perhaps one of his little
nieces has been left in his charge. She sits as quiet as a
mouse with her needlework; but now and then he gives
her a nod, or a kind word, and throwing a little piece
of potassium on to a basin of water for her amusement,
he shows her the metal bursting into purple flame,
floating about in fiery eddies, and the crack of the fused
globule of potash at the end. Presently there is handed
to him the card of some foreign <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i>, who makes his
pilgrimage to the famous Institution and its presiding
genius; he puts down his last result on a slate, comes
upstairs, and, disregarding the interruption, chats with
his visitor with all cordiality and openness. Then to work
again till dinner-time, at half-past two. In the afternoon
he retires to his study with its plain furniture and the
india-rubber tree in the window, and writes a letter full of
affection to some friend, after which he goes off to the
council meeting of one of the learned bodies. Then back
again to the laboratory, but as evening approaches he goes
upstairs to his wife and niece, and then there is a game at
bagatelle or acting charades; and afterwards he will read
aloud from Shakspeare or Macaulay till it is time for supper
and the simple family worship which now is not liable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
interruptions that generally prevent it in the morning. And
so the day closes.</p>

<p>Or if it be a fine summer evening, he takes a stroll with
his wife and the little girl to the Zoological Gardens, and
looks at all the new arrivals, but especially the monkeys,
laughing at their tricks till the tears run down his cheeks.</p>

<p>But should it be a Friday evening, Faraday's place is in
the library and theatre of the Institution, to see that all is
right and ready, to say an encouraging word to the lecturer,
and to welcome his friends as they arrive; then taking his
seat on the front bench near the right hand of the speaker,
he listens with an animated countenance to his story,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> sometimes
bending forwards, and scarcely capable of keeping
his fingers off the apparatus&mdash;not at all able if anything
seems to be going wrong; when the discourse is over, a
warm shake of the hand, with "Thank you for a pleasant
hour," and "Good night" to those around him, and upstairs
with his wife and some particularly congenial friends to
supper. On the dining-table is abundance of good fare and
good wine, and around it flows a pleasant stream of lively
and intellectual conversation.</p>

<p>But suppose it is his own night to lecture. The subject
has been carefully considered, an outline of his discourse
has been written on a sheet of foolscap, with all the
experiments marked and numbered, and during the morning
everything has been arranged on the table in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
order that his memory is assisted by it; the audience now
pours in, and soon occupies all the seats, so that late
comers must be content with sitting on the stairs or standing
in the gangways, or at the back of the gallery. Faraday
enters, and placing himself in the centre of the horse-shoe
table, perfect master of himself, his apparatus, and his
audience, commences a discourse which few that are present
will ever forget. Here is a picture by Lady Pollock:&mdash;"It
was an irresistible eloquence, which compelled attention
and insisted upon sympathy. It waked the young from their
visions, and the old from their dreams. There was a gleaming
in his eyes which no painter could copy, and which no poet
could describe. Their radiance seemed to send a strange
light into the very heart of his congregation; and when
he spoke, it was felt that the stir of his voice and the
fervour of his words could belong only to the owner of
those kindling eyes. His thought was rapid, and made
itself a way in new phrases&mdash;if it found none ready made&mdash;as
the mountaineer cuts steps in the most hazardous ascent
with his own axe. His enthusiasm sometimes carried him
to the point of ecstasy when he expatiated on the beauties
of Nature, and when he lifted the veil from her deep mysteries.
His body then took motion from his mind; his
hair streamed out from his head; his hands were full of
nervous action; his light, lithe body seemed to quiver with
its eager life. His audience took fire with him, and every
face was flushed. Whatever might be the after-thought or
the after-pursuit, each hearer for the time shared his zeal
and his delight."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>Is it possible that he can be happier when lecturing to
the juveniles? The front rows are filled with the young
people; behind them are ranged older friends and many
of his brother philosophers, and there is old Sir James
South, who is quite deaf, poor man, but has come, as he
says, because he likes to see the happy faces of the children.
How perfect is the attention! Faraday, with a beaming
countenance, begins with something about a candle or a
kettle that most boys and girls know, then rises to what
they had never thought of before, but which now is as clear
as possible to their understandings. And with what delight
does he watch the performances of Nature in his experiments!
One could fancy that he had never seen the experiments
before, and that he was about to clap his hands
with boyish glee at the unexpected result! Then with
serious face the lecturer makes some incidental remark that
goes far beyond natural philosophy, and is a lesson for life.</p>

<p>Some will remember one of these occasions which forms
the subject of a painting by Mr. Blaikley. Within the circle
of the table stands the lecturer, and waiting behind is the
trusty Anderson, while the chair is occupied by the Prince
Consort, and beside him are the young Prince of Wales and
his brother, the present Duke of Edinburgh; while the Rev.
John Barlow and Dr. Bence Jones sit on the left of the
Princes; Sir James South stands against the door, and
Murchison, De La Rue, Mrs. Faraday, and others may be
recognized among the eager audience.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose that it is a Sunday on which we
are watching this prince among the aristocracy of intellect,
and we will assume it to be during one of the periods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his eldership, namely between 1840 and 1844, or after 1860.
The first period came to a close through his separation
both from his office and from the Church itself. The
reason of this is unknown except to the parties immediately
concerned, but it will be readily understood how easily
differences may arise in such a community as that of the
Sandemanians between an original and conscientious mind
and his brethren in the faith. He, however, continued to
worship among his friends, and was after a while restored to
the rights of membership, and eventually to the office of
elder. In the morning he and his family group find their
way down to the plain little meeting-house in Paul's Alley,
Red-cross Street, since pulled down to make room for the
Metropolitan Railway. The day's proceedings commence
with a prayer meeting, during which the worshippers gradually
drop in and go to their accustomed seats, Faraday
taking his place on the platform devoted to the elders: then
the more public service begins; one of a metrical but not
rhyming version of the Psalms is sung to a quaint old tune;
the Lord's Prayer and another psalm follow; he rises and
reads in a slow, reverent manner the words of one of the
Evangelists, with a most profound and intelligent appreciation
of their meaning; or he offers an extempore prayer,
expressing perfect trust and submission to God's will, with
deep humility and confession of sin. It may be his turn to
preach. On two sides of a card he has previously sketched
out his sermon with the illustrative texts, but the congregation
does not see the card, only a little Bible in his
hand, the pages of which he turns quickly over, as, fresh
from an earnest heart, there flows a discourse full of devout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
thought, clothed largely in the language of Scripture. After
a loud simultaneous "Amen" has closed the service, the
Church members withdraw to their common meal, the feast
of charity; and in the afternoon there is another service,
ending by invariable custom with the Lord's Supper. The
family group do not reach home till half-past 5; then there
is a quiet evening, part of which is spent by Faraday at his
desk, and they retire to rest at an early hour.</p>

<p>Again on Wednesday evening he is among the little flock.
The service is somewhat freer, for not the officers of the
Church only, but the ordinary members are encouraged to
express whatever thoughts occur to them, so as to edify one
another. At these times, Faraday, especially when he was
not an elder, very often had some word of exhortation, and
the warmth of his temperament would make itself felt, for
he was known in the small community as an experimental
rather than a doctrinal preacher.</p>

<p>The notes of his more formal discourses which I have
had the opportunity of seeing, indicate, as might be expected
from the tenets of his Church, a large acquaintance with the
words of Scripture, but no knowledge of modern exegesis.
They appear to have impressed different hearers in different
ways. One who heard him frequently and was strongly
attached to him, says that his sermons were too parenthetical
and rapid in their delivery, with little variety or attractiveness;
but another scientific friend, who heard him occasionally,
writes: "They struck me as resembling a mosaic
work of texts. At first you could hardly understand their
juxtaposition and relationship, but as the well-chosen pieces
were filled in, by degrees their congruity and fitness became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
developed, and at last an amazing sense of the power and
beauty of the whole filled one's thoughts at the close of the
discourse."</p>

<p>His first sermon as an elder was on Christ's character and
example as shown in Matthew xi. 28-30: "Learn of me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart." Among the latest of
his sermons was one that he preached at Dundee about four
years before his death. He began by telling his audience
that his memory was failing, and he feared he could not
quote Scripture with perfect accuracy; and then, as said one
of the elders who had been present, "his face shone like
the face of an angel," as he poured forth the words of loving
exhortation.</p>

<p>When a mind is stretched in the same direction week-day
and Sunday, the tension is apt to become too great. With
Faraday the first symptom was loss of memory. Then his
devoted wife had to hurry him off to the country for rest of
brain. Once he had to give up work almost entirely for a
twelvemonth. During this time he travelled in Switzerland,
and extracts from his diary are given by Bence Jones. His
niece, Mrs. Deacon, gives us her recollections of a month
spent at Walmer:&mdash;"How I rejoiced to be allowed to go
there with him! We went on the outside of the coach, in
his favourite seat behind the driver. When we reached
Shooter's Hill, he was full of fun about Falstaff and the
men in buckram, and not a sight nor a sound of interest
escaped his quick eye and ear. At Walmer we had a
cottage in a field, and my uncle was delighted because a
window looked directly into a blackbird's nest built in a
cherry-tree. He would go many times in a day to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the parent birds feeding their young. I remember, too,
how much he was interested in the young lambs, after they
were sheared at our door, vainly trying to find their own
mothers. The ewes, not knowing their shorn lambs, did
not make the customary signal. In those days I was eager
to see the sun rise, and my uncle desired me always to call
him when I was awake. So, as soon as the glow brightened
over Pegwell Bay, I stole downstairs and tapped at his door,
and he would rise, and a great treat it was to watch the
glorious sight with him. How delightful, too, to be his
companion at sunset! Once I remember well how we
watched the fading light from a hill clothed with wild
flowers, and how, as twilight stole on, the sounds of bells
from Upper Deal broke upon our ears, and how he watched
till all was grey. At such times he would be well pleased
if we could repeat a few lines descriptive of his feelings."
And then she tells us about their examining the flowers
in the fields by the aid of "Galpin's Botany," and how with
a candle he showed her a spectre on the white mist outside
the window; of reading lessons that ended in laughter, and
of sea-anemones and hermit crabs, with the merriment
caused by their odd movements as they dragged about the
unwieldy shells they tenanted. "But of all things I used
to like to hear him read 'Childe Harold;' and never shall
I forget the way in which he read the description of the
storm on Lake Leman. He took great pleasure in Byron,
and Coleridge's 'Hymn to Mont Blanc' delighted him.
When anything touched his feelings as he read&mdash;and it
happened not unfrequently&mdash;he would show it not only in
his voice, but by tears in his eyes also."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days at Brighton refreshed him for his work. He
was in the habit of running down there before his juvenile
lectures at Christmas, and at Easter he frequently sought
the same sea-breezes.</p>

<p>But it was not always that Faraday could run away from
London when the mental tension became excessive. A
shorter relaxation was procured by his taking up a novel
such as "Ivanhoe," or "Jane Eyre," or "Monte Christo."
He liked the stirring ones best, "a story with a thread to
it." Or he would go with his wife to see Kean act, or hear
Jenny Lind sing, or perhaps to witness the performance of
some "Wizard of the North."</p>

<p>Now and then he would pay a visit to some scene of
early days. One of his near relatives tells me: "It is said
that Mr. Faraday once went to the shop where his father
had formerly been employed as a blacksmith, and asked to
be allowed to look over the place. When he got to a part
of the premises at which there was an opening into the
lower workshop, he stopped and said: 'I very nearly lost
my life there once. I was playing in the upper room at
pitching halfpence into a pint pot close by this hole, and
having succeeded at a certain distance, I stepped back to try
my fortune further off, forgetting the aperture, and down I
fell; and if it had not been that my father was working over
an anvil fixed just below, I should have fallen on it, broken
my back, and probably killed myself. As it was, my father's
back just saved mine.'"</p>

<p>Business, as well as pleasure, sometimes took him away
from home. He often joined the British Association, returning
usually on Saturday, that he might be among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
own people on the Lord's Day. During the meeting he
would generally accept the hospitality of some friend; and
it was one of these occasions that gave rise to the following
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent16">"T. T.</div>
<div class="verse">"<span class="smcap">Oxford</span>, <em>June 27, 1860</em>."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the Liverpool meeting, in 1837, he was president of
the Chemical Section, and on two other occasions he was
selected to deliver the evening lecture, but though repeatedly
pressed to undertake the presidency of the whole body, he
could not be prevailed upon to accept the office.</p>

<p>My first personal intercourse with him, of any extent, was
at the Ipswich meeting in 1851. I watched him with all
the interest of an admiring disciple, and there is deeply engraven
on my memory the vivacity of his conversation, the
eagerness with which he entered into some mathematico-chemical
speculations of Dumas, and the playfulness with
which, when we were dining together, he cut boomerangs out
of card, and shot them across the table at his friends.</p>

<p>Professional engagements also took him not unfrequently
into the country. Some of these will be described in the
later sections, that treat of his mode of working and its
valuable results.</p>

<p>To comprehend a man's life it is necessary to know
not merely what he does, but also what he purposely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
leaves undone. There is a limit to the work that can
be got out of a human body or a human brain, and he is
a wise man who wastes no energy on pursuits for which
he is not fitted; and he is still wiser who, from among the
things that he can do well, chooses and resolutely follows
the best.</p>

<p>Faraday took no part in any of the political or social
movements of his time. To politics indeed he seems to
have been really indifferent. It was during the intensely
interesting period of 1814-15 that he was on the Continent
with Davy, but he alludes to the taking of Paris by the
allied troops simply because of its bearing on the movements
of the travellers, and on March 7, 1815, he made his
remarkable entry in his journal: "I heard for news that
Bonaparte was again at liberty. Being no politician, I did
not trouble myself much about it, though I suppose it will
have a strong influence on the affairs of Europe." In later
days he seems to have awaked to sufficient interest to read
the debates, and to show a Conservative tendency; he
became a special constable in 1848, and was disposed
generally to support "the powers that be,"&mdash;though that
involved some perplexity at a change of Government.</p>

<p>It is more singular that a man of his benevolent spirit
should never have taken a prominent part in any philanthropic
movement. In some cases his religious views may
have presented an obstacle, but this reason can hardly apply
to many of those social movements in which the influence
of his name, and his occasional presence and advice, would
have been highly valuable. During the latter half of his life,
he, as a rule, avoided serving on committees even for scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
objects, and was reluctant to hold office in the learned
societies with which he was connected. I believe, however,
that this arose not so much from want of interest, as from a
conviction that he was ill-suited by natural temperament for
joining in discussions on subjects that roused the passions of
men, or for calmly weighing the different courses of action,
and deciding which was the most judicious. It is remarkable
how little even of his scientific work was done in conjunction
with others. Neither did he spend time in rural occupations,
or in literary or artistic pursuits. Beasts and birds
and flowers he looked at, but it was for recreation, not for
study. Music he was fond of, and occasionally he visited
the Opera, but he did not allow sweet sounds to charm him
away from his work. He stuck closely to his fireside, his
laboratory, his lecture table, and his church. He lived where
he worked, so that he had only to go downstairs to put to
the test of experiment any fresh thought that flitted across
his brain. He almost invariably declined dinner-parties,
except at Lady Davy's, and at Mr. and Mrs. Masquerier's
at Brighton, towards whom he felt under an obligation on
account of former kindnesses. If he went to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i>, he
usually stayed but a short time; and even when away from
home he generally refused private hospitality. Thus he was
able to give almost undivided attention to the chief pursuit
of his life.</p>

<p>His residence in so accessible a part of London did, however,
expose him to the constant invasion of callers, and his
own good nature often rendered fruitless the efforts that
were considerately made to restrict these within reasonable
limits. Of course he suffered from the curious and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
inconsiderate of the human species; and then there were
those pertinacious bores, the dabblers in science. "One
morning a young man called on him, and with an air of
great importance confided to him the result of some original
researches (so he deemed them) in electrical philosophy.
'And pray,' asked the Professor, taking down a volume of
Rees' Cyclopædia, 'did you consult this or any elementary
work to learn whether your discovery had been anticipated?'
The young man replied in the negative. 'Then why do
you come to waste my time about well-known facts, that
were published forty years ago?' 'Sir,' said the visitor, 'I
thought I had better bring the matter to head-quarters immediately.'
'All very well for you, but not so well for head-quarters,'
replied the Professor, sharply, and set him down
to read the article."</p>

<p>"A grave, elderly gentleman once waited upon him to
submit to his notice 'a new law of physics.' The visitor requested
that a jug of water and a tumbler might be brought,
and then producing a cork, 'You will be pleased to observe,'
said he, 'how persistently this cork clings to the side of the
glass when the vessel is half filled.' 'Just so,' replied the
Professor. 'But now,' resumed this great discoverer, 'mark
what happens when I fill the tumbler to the brim. There!
you see the cork flies to the centre&mdash;positively repelled by
the sides!' 'Precisely so,' replied the amused electrician,
with the air of a man who felt perfectly at home with the
phenomenon, and indeed regarded it quite as an old friend.
The visitor was evidently disconcerted. 'Pray how long
have you known this?' he ventured to ask Faraday. 'Oh,
ever since I was a boy,' was the rejoinder. Crestfallen&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
discovery demolished in a moment&mdash;the poor gentleman was
retiring with many apologies, when the Professor, sincerely
concerned at his disappointment, comforted him by suggesting
that possibly he might some day alight upon something
really new."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>But there were other visitors who were right welcome to a
portion of his time. One day it might be a young man,
whom a few kind words and a little attention on the part of
the great philosopher would send forward on the journey of
life with new energy and hopes. Another day it might be
some intellectual chieftain, who could meet the prince of
experimenters on equal terms. But these are hardly to be
regarded as interruptions;&mdash;rather as a part of his chosen
work.</p>

<p>Here is one instance in the words of Mr. Robert Mallet.
"... I was, in the years that followed, never in London
without paying him a visit, and on one of those times I
ventured to ask him (if not too much engaged) to let me see
where he and Davy had worked together. With the most
simple graciousness he brought me through the whole of
the Royal Institution, Albemarle Street. Brande's furnaces,
Davy's battery, the place in the laboratory where he told
me he had first observed the liquefaction of chlorine, are all
vividly before me&mdash;but nothing so clear or vivid as our
conversation over a specimen of green (crown) glass, partially
devitrified in floating opaque white spheres of radiating
crystals: he touched luminously on the obscure relation of
the vitreous and crystalloid states, and on the probable
nature of the nuclei of the white spheres. My next visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Faraday that I recollect was not long after my paper 'On the
Dynamics of Earthquakes' had appeared in the Transactions
of the Royal Irish Academy. He almost at once referred
to it in terms of praise that seemed to me so far beyond
my due, that even now I recall the very humble way I
felt, as the thought of Faraday's own transcendent merits
rushed across my mind. I ventured to ask him, had the
paper engaged his attention sufficiently that I might ask
him&mdash;did he consider my explanation of the before supposed
<em>vorticose</em> shock sufficient? To my amazement he at
once recited <em>nearly word for word</em> the paragraph in which
I took some pains to put my views into a demonstrative
shape, and ended with, 'It is as plain and certain as a
proposition of Euclid!' And yet the subject was one
pretty wide away from his own objects of study."</p>

<p>Often, too, if some interesting fact was exhibited to him,
he would send to his brother <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> some such note as
this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>4th May, 1852</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Wheatstone</span>,</p>

<p>"Dr. Dubois-Raymond will be making his experiments
<em>here</em> next Thursday, the 6th, from and after 11 o'clock.
I wish to let you know, that you may if you like join the
select few.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Ever truly yours,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was indeed his wont to share with others the delight of
a new discovery. Thus Sir Henry Holland tells me that he
used frequently to run to his house in Brook Street with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
some piece of scientific news. One of these visits was after
reading Bunsen and Kirchhoff's paper on Spectrum Analysis;
and he did not stop short with merely telling the tale of the
special rays of light shot forth by each metallic vapour, as
the following letter will show. It is addressed to the present
Baroness Burdett Coutts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>Friday, 17th May</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Coutts</span>,</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at 4 o'clock, immediately after Max
Müller's lecture, I shall show Sir Henry Holland an apparatus
which has arrived from Munich to manifest the phenomena
of light which have recently been made known to us by
Bunsen and Kirchhoff. Mr. Barlow will be here, and he
suggests that you would like to know of the occasion. If
you are inclined to see how philosophers work and live, and
so are inclined to climb our narrow stairs (for I must show
the experiments in my room), we shall be most happy to
see you. The experiments will not be beautiful except to
the intelligent.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Ever your faithful Servant,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, too, the exhibition of a scientific fact would
take him away from home. Thus, when her Majesty and
the Prince Consort once paid a private visit to the Polytechnic,
Mr. Pepper arranged a surprise for the Royal party,
by getting Faraday in a quiet room to explain the Ruhmkorff's
coil&mdash;the latest development of his own inductive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
currents. This he did with his usual vivacity and enthusiasm,
and the interview is said to have gratified the philosopher
as well as the Queen.</p>

<p>He could not, however, escape the inroads made upon
his time by correspondence. People would write and ask
him questions. Once a solitary prisoner wrote to tell him,
"It is indeed in studying the great discoveries which science
is indebted to you for, that I render my captivity less sad,
and make time flow with rapidity,"&mdash;and then he proceeds
to ask, "<em>What is the most simple</em> combination to give to a
voltaic battery, in order to produce a spark capable of setting
fire to powder under water, or under ground? Up to the
present I have only seen employed to that purpose piles of
thirty to forty pairs constructed on Dr. Wollaston's principles.
They are very large and inconvenient for field service.
Could not the same effect be produced by two spiral pairs
only? and if so, what can be their smallest dimension?"
And who was the prisoner who thus speculated on the
applications of science to war? It was no other than Prince
Louis Napoleon, then immured in the fortress of Ham,
and now the ex-Emperor of the French. At another time
he wrote asking for his advice in the manufacture of an
alloy which should be about as soft as lead, but not so
fusible,&mdash;a question which also had evident bearing upon
the art of war; and offering at the same time to pay the cost
of any experiments that might be necessary.</p>

<p>Often, too, the correspondents of Faraday thought that
they were doing him a kindness. He says somewhere:
"The number of suggestions, hints for discovery, and propositions
of various kinds, offered to me very freely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with perfect goodwill and simplicity on the part of the
proposers, for my exclusive investigation and final honour,
is remarkably great, and it is no less remarkable that but
for one exception&mdash;that of Mr. Jenkin&mdash;they have all been
worthless.... I have, I think, universally found that the
man whose mind was by nature or self-education fitted to
make good and worthy suggestions, was also the man both
able and willing to work them out."</p>

<p>Both the askers of questions and the givers of advice
expected answers&mdash;and the answers came. Most of Faraday's
letters, indeed, are of a purely business character:
sometimes they are very laconic, as the note in which he
announced to Dr. Paris one of his principal discoveries:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"The <em>oil</em> you noticed yesterday turns out to be
liquid chlorine.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>But in other letters, as may be expected, there is found
the enthusiasm of his ardent nature, or the glow of his
genial spirit. An instance or two may suffice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>24th March, 1843</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have received and at once looked at your
paper. Many thanks for so good a contribution to the
beloved science. What glorious steps electricity has taken
in the days within our remembrance, and what hopes are
held out for the future! The great difficulty is to remove
the mists which dim the dawn of a subject, and I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but consider your paper as doing very much that way for
a most important part of natural knowledge.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent6">"I am, my dear Sir,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Moore</span>,</p>

<p>"The summer is going away, and I never (but for
one day) had any hopes of profiting by your kind offer of
the roof of your house in Clarges Street. What a feeble
summer it has been as regards sunlight! I have made a
good many preliminary experiments at home, but they do
not encourage me in the direction towards which I was
looking. All is misty and dull, both the physical and the
mental prospect. But I have ever found that the experimental
philosopher has great need of patience, that he may
not be downcast by interposing obstacles, and perseverance,
that he may either overcome them, or open out a new path
to the bourn he desires to reach. So perhaps next summer
I may think of your housetop again. Many thanks for
your kind letter and all your kindnesses uswards. My wife
had your note yesterday, and I enjoyed the violets, which
for a time I appropriated.</p>

<p>The following is written to Mr. Frank Barnard, then an
Art student in Paris:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>9th Nov., 1852</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Nephew</span>,</p>

<p>"Though I am not a letter-writer and shall not
profess to send you any news, yet I intend to waste your
time with one sheet of paper: first to thank you for your
letter to me, and then to thank you for what I hear of your
letters to others. You were very kind to take the trouble
of executing my commissions, when I know your heart was
bent upon the entrance to your studies. Your account of
M. Arago was most interesting to me, though I should have
been glad if in the matter of health you could have made it
better. He has a wonderful mind and spirit. And so you
are hard at work, and somewhat embarrassed by your position:
but no man can do just as he likes, and in many
things he has to give way, and may do so honourably,
provided he preserve his self-respect. Never, my dear
Frank, lose that, whatever may be the alternative. Let no
one tempt you to it; for nothing can be expedient that is
not right; and though some of your companions may
tease you at first, they will respect you for your consistency
in the end; and if they pretend not to do so, it is of no
consequence. However, I trust the hardest part of your
probation is over, for the earliest is usually the hardest; and
that you know how to take all things quietly. Happily
for you, there is nothing in your pursuit which need embarrass
you in Paris. I think you never cared for home
politics, so that those of another country are not likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
occupy your attention, and a stranger can be but a very
poor judge of a new people and their requisites.</p>

<p>"I think all your family are pretty well, but I know you
will hear all the news from your appointed correspondent
Jane, and, as I said, I am unable to chronicle anything.
Still, I am always very glad to hear how you are going on,
and have a sight of all that I may see of the correspondence.</p>

<p>His scientific researches were very numerous. The Royal
Society Catalogue gives under the name of Faraday a list
of 158 papers, published in various scientific magazines or
learned Transactions. Many of these communications are
doubtless short, but a short philosophical paper often represents
a large amount of brain work; a score of them are
the substance of his Friday evening discourses; while others
are lengthy treatises, the records of long and careful investigations;
and the list includes the thirty series of his
"Experimental Researches in Electricity." These extended
over a period of twenty-seven years, and were afterwards
reprinted from the "Philosophical Transactions," and form
three goodly volumes, with 3,430 numbered paragraphs&mdash;one
of the most marvellous monuments of intellectual work, one
of the rarest treasure-houses of newly-discovered knowledge,
with which the world has ever been enriched. Faraday
never published but one book in the common acceptation
of the term&mdash;it was on "Chemical Manipulation,"&mdash;but
there appeared another large volume of reprinted papers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and three of his courses of lectures were also published as
separate small books, though not by himself. It is very
tempting to linger among these 158 papers; but this is
not intended as a scientific biography, and those readers
who wish to make themselves better acquainted with his
work will find an admirable summary of it in Professor
Tyndall's "Faraday as a Discoverer." In Sections IV.
and V., however, I have endeavoured to give an idea of
his manner of working, and of the practical benefits that
have flowed to mankind from some of his discoveries.</p>

<p>As these papers appeared his fame grew wider and wider.
When a comparatively young man he was naturally desirous
of appending the mystic letters "F.R.S." to his name, and
he was balloted into the Royal Society in January 1824, not
without strong opposition from his master, Sir Humphry
Davy, then president. He paid the fees, and never sought
another distinction of the kind. But they were showered
down upon him. The Philosophical Society of Cambridge
had already acknowledged his merits, and the learned Academies
of Paris and Florence had enrolled him amongst
their corresponding members. Heidelberg and St. Petersburg,
Philadelphia and Boston, Copenhagen, Berlin, and Palermo,
quickly followed: and as the fame of his researches
spread, very many other learned societies in Europe and
America, as well as at home, brought to him the tribute
of their honorary membership.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He thrice received the
degree of Doctor, Oxford making him a D.C.L., Prague a
Ph.D., and Cambridge an LL.D., besides which he was
instituted a Chevalier of the Prussian Order of Merit, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Commander of the Legion of Honour, and a Knight Commander
of the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus. Among
the medals which he received were each of those at the disposal
of the Royal Society&mdash;indeed the Copley medal was
given him twice&mdash;and the Grande Médaille d'Honneur at
the time of the French Exhibition. Altogether it appears
he was decorated with ninety-five titles and marks of merit,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
including the blue ribbon of science, for in 1844 he was
chosen one of the eight foreign associates of the French
Academy.</p>

<p>Though he had never passed through a university career,
he was made a member of the Senate of the University of
London, which he regarded as one of his chief honours;
and he showed his appreciation of the importance of the
office by a diligent attendance to its duties.</p>

<p>As the recognized prince of investigators, it is no wonder
that on the resignation of Lord Wrottesley, an attempt was
made to induce him to become President of the Royal
Society. A deputation waited upon him and urged the
unanimous wish of the Council and of scientific men.
Faraday begged for time to consider. Tyndall gives us
an insight into the reasons that led him to decline. He
tells us: "On the following morning I went up to his room,
and said, on entering, that I had come to him with some
anxiety of mind. He demanded its cause, and I responded,
'Lest you should have decided against the wishes of the
deputation that waited on you yesterday.' 'You would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
urge me to undertake this responsibility,' he said. 'I not
only urge you,' was my reply, 'but I consider it your
bounden duty to accept it.' He spoke of the labour that
it would involve; urged that it was not in his nature to take
things easy; and that if he became president, he would
surely have to stir many new questions, and agitate for
some changes. I said that in such cases he would find
himself supported by the youth and strength of the Royal
Society. This, however, did not seem to satisfy him.
Mrs. Faraday came into the room, and he appealed to
her. Her decision was adverse, and I deprecated her
decision. 'Tyndall,' he said at length, 'I must remain
plain Michael Faraday to the last; and let me now tell
you, that if I accepted the honour which the Royal Society
desires you to confer upon me, I would not answer for the
integrity of my intellect for a single year.'"</p>

<p>In 1835 Sir Robert Peel desired to confer pensions as
honourable distinctions on Faraday and some other eminent
men. Lord Melbourne, who succeeded him as Prime
Minister, in making the offer at a private interview, gave
utterance to some hasty expressions that appeared to the
man of science to reflect on the honour of his profession,
and led to his declining the money. The King, William
IV., was struck with the unusual nature of the proceeding,
and kept repeating the story of Faraday's refusal; and
about a month afterwards the Premier, dining with Dr.
(now Sir Henry) Holland, begged him to convey a letter
to the Professor and to press on him the acceptance of
the pension. The letter was couched in such honourable
and conciliatory terms, that Faraday's personal objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
could no longer apply, and he expressed his willingness
to receive this mark of national approval. A version of
the matter that found its way into the public prints caused
fresh annoyance, and nearly produced a final refusal, but
through the kind offices of friends who had interested
themselves throughout in the matter, a friendly feeling
was again arrived at, and the pension of £300 a year
was granted and accepted.</p>

<p>In 1858 the Queen offered him a house at Hampton
Court. It was a pretty little place, situated in the well-known
Green in front of the Palace; and in that quiet retreat
Faraday spent a large portion of his remaining years.</p>

<p>In October 1861 he wrote a letter to the managers of
the Royal Institution, resigning part of his duties, in which
he reviewed his connection with them. "I entered the
Royal Institution in March 1813, nearly forty-nine years
ago, and, with the exception of a comparatively short period
during which I was abroad on the Continent with Sir H.
Davy, have been with you ever since. During that time I
have been most happy in your kindness, and in the fostering
care which the Royal Institution has bestowed upon me.
Thank God, first, for all His gifts. I have next to thank
you and your predecessors for the unswerving encouragement
and support which you have given me during that
period. My life has been a happy one, and all I desired.
During its progress I have tried to make a fitting return
for it to the Royal Institution, and through it to science.
But the progress of years (now amounting in number to three-score
and ten) having brought forth first the period of development,
and then that of maturity, have ultimately produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for me that of gentle decay. This has taken place in such
a manner as to make the evening of life a blessing; for
whilst increasing physical weakness occurs, a full share of
health free from pain is granted with it; and whilst memory
and certain other faculties of the mind diminish, my
good spirits and cheerfulness do not diminish with them."</p>

<p>When he could no longer discharge effectually his duties
at the Trinity House, the Corporation quietly made their
arrangements for transferring them, and, with the concurrence
of the Board of Trade, determined that his salary of
200<em>l.</em> per annum should continue as long as he lived. Sir
Frederick Arrow called upon him at Albemarle Street, and
explained how the matter stood, but he found it hard to
persuade the Professor that there was no injustice in his
continuing to receive the money; then, taking hold of Sir
Frederick by one hand and Dr. Tyndall by the other,
Faraday, with swimming eyes, passed over his office to
his successor.</p>

<p>Gradually but surely the end approached. The loss of
memory was followed by other symptoms of declining power.
The fastenings of his earthly tabernacle were removed one
by one, and he looked forward to "the house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens." This was no new
anticipation. Calling on the friend who had long directed
with him the affairs of the Institution, but who was then
half paralysed, he had said, "Barlow, you and I are waiting;
that is what we have to do now; and we must try to do it
patiently." He had written to his niece, Mrs. Deacon: "I
cannot think that death has to the Christian anything in it
that should make it rare, or other than a constant, thought;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
out of the view of death comes the view of the life beyond
the grave, as out of the view of sin (the true and the real
view which the Holy Spirit alone can give to a man) comes
the glorious hope.... My worldly faculties are slipping
away day by day. Happy is it for all of us that the true
good lies not in them. As they ebb, may they leave us as
little children trusting in the Father of Mercies, and accepting
His unspeakable gift." And when the dark shadow was
creeping over him, he wrote to the Comte de Paris: "I bow
before Him who is Lord of all, and hope to be kept waiting
patiently for His time and mode of releasing me according
to His Divine Word, and the great and precious promises
whereby His people are made partakers of the Divine nature."
His niece, Miss Jane Barnard, who tended him with most
devoted care, thus wrote from Hampton Court on the 27th
June:&mdash;"The kind feelings shown on every side towards my
dear uncle, and the ready offers of help, are most soothing.
I am thankful to say that we are going on very quietly; he
keeps his bed and sleeps much, and we think that the
paralysis gains on him, but between whiles he speaks most
pleasant words, showing his comfort and trust in the finished
work of our Lord. The other day he repeated some verses
of the 46th Psalm, and yesterday a great part of the 23rd.
We can only trust that it may be given us to say truly,
'Thy will be done;' indeed, the belief that all things
work together for good to them that believe, is an anchor
of hope, sure and steadfast, to the soul. We are surrounded
by most kind and affectionate friends, and it is indeed
touching to see what warm feelings my dear uncle has
raised on all sides."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>When his faculties were fading fast, he would sit long at
the western window, watching the glories of the sunset;
and one day when his wife drew his attention to a beautiful
rainbow that then spanned the sky, he looked beyond
the falling shower and the many-coloured arch, and
observed, "He hath set his testimony in the heavens."
On August 25, 1867, quietly, almost imperceptibly, came
the release. There was a philosopher less on earth, and a
saint more in heaven.</p>

<p>The funeral, at his own request, was of the simplest
character. His remains were conveyed to Highgate
Cemetery by his relations, and deposited in the grave,
according to the practice of his Church, in perfect silence.
Few of his scientific friends were in London that bright
summer-time, but Professor Graham and one or two others
came out from the shrubbery, and joining the group of
family mourners, took their last look at the coffin.</p>

<p>But when this sun had set below our earthly horizon,
there seemed to spring up in the minds of men a great
desire to catch some of the rays of the fading brightness
and reflect them to posterity. A "Faraday Memorial" was
soon talked of, and the work is now in the sculptor's
hands; the Chemical Society has founded a "Faraday
Lectureship;" one of the new streets in Paris has been
called "Rue Faraday;" biographical sketches have appeared
in many of the British and Continental journals; successive
books have told the story of his life and work; and
in a thousand hearts there is embalmed the memory of this
Christian gentleman and philosopher.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">SECTION II.<br />

<span class="medfont">STUDY OF HIS CHARACTER.</span></h2>

<p>In the previous section we have traced the leading events
of a life which was quietly and uniformly successful. We
have watched the passage of the errand-boy into the
philosopher, and we have seen how at first he begged for
the meanest place in a scientific workshop, and at last
declined the highest honour which British Science was
capable of granting. His success did not lie in the
amassing of money&mdash;he deliberately turned aside from the
path of proffered wealth; nor did it lie in the attainment
of social position and titles&mdash;he did not care for
the weight of these. But if success consists in a life
full of agreeable occupation, with the knowledge that its
labours are adding to the happiness and wealth of the
world, leading on to an old age full of honour, and the
prospect of a blissful immortality,&mdash;then the highest success
crowned the life of Faraday.</p>

<p>How did he obtain it? Not by inheritance, and not by
the force of circumstances. The wealth or the reputation
of fathers is often an invaluable starting-point for sons: a
liberal education and the contact of superior minds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
early youth is often a mighty help to the young aspirant:
the favour of powerful friends will often place on a vantage-ground
the struggler in the battle of life. But Faraday had
none of these. Accidental circumstances sometimes push
a man forward, or give him a special advantage over his
fellows; but Faraday had to make his circumstances, and
to seize the small favours that fortune sometimes threw in
his way. The secret of his success lay in the qualities of
his mind.</p>

<p>It is only fair, however, to remark that he started with no
disadvantages. There was no stain in the family history:
he had no dead weight to carry, of a disgraced name, or of
bad health, or deficient faculties, or hereditary tendencies to
vice. It must be acknowledged, too, that he was endowed
with a naturally clear understanding and an unusual power
of looking below the surface of things.</p>

<p>The first element of success that we meet with in his
biography is the faithfulness with which he did his work.
This led the bookseller to take his poor errand-boy as an
apprentice; and this enabled his father to write, when he
was 18: "Michael is bookbinder and stationer, and is very
active at learning his business. He has been most part of
four years of his time out of seven. He has a very good master
and mistress, and likes his place well. He had a hard time
for some while at first going; but, as the old saying goes,
he has rather got the head above water, as there is two other
boys under him." This faithful industry marked also his
relations with Davy and Brande, and the whole of his subsequent
life; and at last, when he found that he could no
longer discharge his duties, it made him repeatedly press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his resignation on the managers of the Royal Institution,
and beg to be relieved of his eldership in the Church.</p>

<p>His love of study, and hunger after knowledge, led him
to the particular career which he pursued, and that power
of imagination, which reveals itself in his early letters,
grew and grew, till it gave him such a familiarity with
the unseen forces of nature as has never been vouchsafed
to any other mortal.</p>

<p>As a source of success there stands out also his enthusiasm.
A new fact seemed to charge him with an energy
that gleamed from his eyes and quivered through his limbs,
and, as by induction, charged for the time those in his
presence with the same vigour of interest. Plücker, of
Bonn, was showing him one day in the laboratory at Albemarle
Street his experiments on the action of a magnet on
the electric discharge in vacuum tubes. Faraday danced
round them; and as he saw the moving arches of light, he
cried, "Oh! to live in it!" Mr. James Heywood once
met him in the thick of a tremendous storm at Eastbourne,
rubbing his hands with delight because he had
been fortunate enough to see the lightning strike the church
tower, and displace a pinnacle.</p>

<p>This enthusiasm led him to throw all his heart into his
work. Nor was the energy spasmodic, or wasted on
unworthy objects; for, in the words of Bence Jones, his
was "a lifelong lasting strife to seek and say that which
he thought was true, and to do that which he thought
was kind."</p>

<p>Indeed, his perseverance in a noble strife was another of
the grand elements in his success. His tenacity of purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
showed itself equally in little and in great things. Arranging
some apparatus one day with a philosophical instrument
maker, he let fall on the floor a small piece of glass: he
made several ineffectual attempts to pick it up. "Never
mind," said his companion, "it is not worth the trouble."
"Well, but, Murray, I don't like to be beaten by something
that I have once tried to do."</p>

<p>The same principle is apparent in that long series of
electrical researches, where for a quarter of a century he
marched steadily along that path of discovery into which he
had been lured by the genius of Davy. And so, whatever
course was set before him, he ran with patience towards the
goal, not diverted by the thousand objects of interest which
he passed by, nor stopping to pick up the golden apples
that were flung before his feet.</p>

<p>This tremendous faculty of work was relieved by a
wonderful playfulness. This rarely appears in his writings,
but was very frequent in his social intercourse. It was a
simple-hearted joyousness, the effervescence of a spirit at
peace with God and man. It not seldom, however, assumed
the form of good-natured banter or a practical joke. Indications
of this playfulness have already been given, and
I have tried to put upon paper some instances that occur
to my own recollection, but the fun depended so much
upon his manner, that it loses its aroma when separated
from himself.</p>

<p>However, I will try one story. I was spending a night at
an hotel at Ramsgate when on lighthouse business. Early in
the morning there came a knock at the bed-room door, but,
as I happened to be performing my ablutions, I cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Who's there?" "Guess." I went over the names of my
brother commissioners, but heard only "No, no," till, not
thinking of any other friend likely to hunt me up in that
place, I left off guessing; and on opening the door I saw
Faraday enjoying with a laugh my inability to recognize
his voice through a deal board.</p>

<p>A student of the late Professor Daniell tells me that he
remembers Faraday often coming into the lecture-room at
King's College just when the Professor had finished and
was explaining matters more fully to any of his pupils who
chose to come down to the table. One day the subject discoursed
on and illustrated had been sulphuretted hydrogen,
and a little of the gas had escaped into the room, as it
perversely will do. When Faraday entered he put on a
look of astonishment, as though he had never smelt such
a thing before, and in a comical manner said, "Ah! a
savoury lecture, Daniell!" On another occasion there was
a little ammonia left in a jar over mercury. He pressed
Daniell to tell him what it was, and when the Professor
had put his head down to see more clearly, he whiffed some
of the pungent gas into his face.</p>

<p>Occasionally this humour was turned to good account, as
when, one Friday evening before the lecture, he told the
audience that he had been requested by the managers to
mention two cases of infringement of rule. The first related
to the red cord which marks off the members' seats. "The
second case I take to be a hypothetical one, namely, that of
a gentleman wearing his hat in the drawing-room." This
produced a laugh, which the Professor joined in, bowed, and
retired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>This faithful discharge of duty, this almost intuitive
insight into natural phenomena, and this persevering enthusiasm
in the pursuit of truth, might alone have secured a
great position in the scientific world, but they alone could
never have won for him that large inheritance of respect
and love. His contemporaries might have gazed upon him
with an interest and admiration akin to that with which he
watched a thunderstorm; but who feels his affections drawn
out towards a mere intellectual Jupiter? We must look
deeper into his character to understand this. There is a
law well recognized in the science of light and heat, that a
body can absorb only the same sort of rays which it is
capable of emitting. Just so is it in the moral world. The
respect and love of his generation were given to Faraday
because his own nature was full of love and respect for
others.</p>

<p>Each of these qualities&mdash;his respect for and love to
others, or, more generally, his reverence and kindliness&mdash;deserves
careful examination.</p>

<p>Throughout his life, Michael Faraday appeared as though
standing in a reverential attitude towards Nature, Man,
and God.</p>

<p>Towards Nature, for he regarded the universe as a vast
congeries of facts which would not bend to human theories.
Speaking of his own early life, he says: "I was a very lively
imaginative person, and could believe in the 'Arabian
Nights' as easily as in the 'Encyclopædia;' but facts were
important to me, and saved me. I could trust a fact, and
always cross-examined an assertion." He was indeed a true
disciple of that philosophy which says, "Man, who is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
servant and interpreter of Nature, can act and understand
no farther than he has, either in operation or in contemplation,
observed of the method and order of Nature."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
And verily Nature admitted her servant into her secret
chambers, and showed him marvels to interpret to his
fellow-men more wonderful and beautiful than the phantasmagoria
of Eastern romance.</p>

<p>His reverence towards Man showed itself in the respect
he uniformly paid to others and to himself. Thoroughly
genuine and simple-hearted himself, he was wont to credit
his fellow-men with high motives and good reasons. This
was rather uncomfortable when one was conscious of no
such merit, and I at least have felt ashamed in his presence
of the poor commonplace grounds of my words and actions.
To be in his company was in fact a moral tonic. As he
had learned the difficult art of honouring all men, he was
not likely to run after those whom the world counted great.
"We must get Garibaldi to come some Friday evening,"
said a member of the Institution during the visit of the
Italian hero to London. "Well, if Garibaldi thinks he can
learn anything from us, we shall be happy to see him," was
Faraday's reply. This nobility of regard not only preserved
him from envying the success of other explorers in the
same field, but led him heartily to rejoice with them in their
discoveries.</p>

<p>Dumas gives us a picture of Foucault showing Faraday
some of his admirable experiments, and of the two men
looking at one another with eyes moistened, but full of
bright expression, as they stood hand in hand, silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thankful&mdash;the one for the pleasure he had experienced, the
other for the honour that had been done him. He also
tells how, on another occasion, he breakfasted at Albemarle
Street, and during the meal Mr. Faraday made some eulogistic
remarks upon Davy, which were coldly received by
his guest. After breakfast, he was taken downstairs to the
ante-room of the lecture theatre, when Faraday, walking up
to the portrait of his old master, exclaimed, "Wasn't he a
great man!" then turning round to the window next the
entrance door, he added, "It was there that he spoke to me
for the first time." The Frenchman bowed. They descended
the stairs again to the laboratory. Faraday pulled out an
old note-book, and turning over its pages showed where
Davy had entered the means by which the first globule of
potassium was produced, and had drawn a line round the
description, with the words, "Capital experiment." The
French chemist owned himself vanquished, and tells the
tale in honour of him who remembered the greatness and
forgot the littlenesses of his teacher.</p>

<p>And the respect he showed to others he required to be
shown to himself. It is difficult to imagine anyone taking
liberties with him, and it was only in early life that there
were small-minded creatures who would treat him not
according to what he was, but according to the position
from which he had risen. His servants and workpeople
were always attentive to the smallest expression of his
wish. Still, he did not "go through his life with his elbows
out." He once wrote to Matteucci: "I see that that moves
you which would move me most, viz. the imputation of
a want of good faith; and I cordially sympathize with anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
who is so charged unjustly. Such cases have seemed
to me almost the only ones for which it is worth while
entering into controversy. I have felt myself not unfrequently
misunderstood, often misrepresented, sometimes
passed by, as in the cases of specific inductive capacity,
magneto-electric currents, definite electrolytic action, &amp;c.
&amp;c.: but it is only in the cases where moral turpitude
has been implied, that I have felt called upon to enter on
the subject in reply." Yet, where he felt that his honour
was impugned, none could be more sensitive or more
resolute.</p>

<p>This desire to clear himself, combined with his delicate
regard for the feelings of others, struck me forcibly in the
following incident. At Mr. Barlow's, one Friday evening
after the discourse, two or three other chemists and myself
were commenting unfavourably on a public act of Faraday,
when suddenly he appeared beside us. I did not hesitate
to tell him my opinion. He gave me a short answer, and
joined others of the company. A few days afterwards
he found me in the laboratory preparing for a lecture,
and, without referring directly to what I had said, he
gave me a full history of the transaction in such a way
as to show that he could not have acted otherwise, and
at the same time to render any apology on my part
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Intimately connected with his respect for Man as well as
reverence for truth, was the flash of his indignation against
any injustice, and his hot anger against any whom he discovered
to be pretenders. When, for instance, he had
convinced himself that the reputed facts of table-turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and spiritualism were false, his severe denunciation of the
whole thing followed as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Thus, too, a story is told of his once taking the side of
the injured in a street quarrel by the pump in Savile Row.
One evening also at my house, a young man who has since
acquired a scientific renown was showing specimens of
some new compounds he had made. A well-known chemist
contemptuously objected that, after all, they were mere products
of the laboratory: but Faraday came to the help of
the young experimenter, and contended that they were
chemical substances worthy of attention, just as much as
though they occurred in nature.</p>

<p>His reverence for God was shown not merely by that
homage which every religious man must pay to his Creator
and Redeemer, but by the enfolding of the words of Scripture
and similar expressions in such a robe of sacredness,
that he rarely allowed them to pass his lips or flow from his
pen, unless he was convinced of the full sympathy of the
person with whom he was holding intercourse.</p>

<p>This characteristic reverence was united to an equally
characteristic kindliness. This word does not exactly
express the quality intended; but unselfishness is negative,
goodness is too general, love is commonly used with special
applications; kindness, friendship, geniality, and benevolence
are only single aspects of the quality. Let the reader
add these terms all together, and the resultant will be about
what is meant.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Faraday's love to children was one way in which this
kindliness was shown. Having no children of his own, he
surrounded himself usually with his nieces: we have already
had a glimpse of him heartily entering into their play, and
we are told how a word or two from Uncle would clear away
all the trouble from a difficult lesson, that a long sum in
arithmetic became a delight when he undertook to explain
it, and that when the little girl was naughty and rebellious,
he could gently win her round, telling her how he used to
feel himself when he was young, and advising her to submit
to the reproof she was fighting against. Nor were his own
relatives the only sharers of his kindness. One friend
cherishes among his earliest recollections, that of Faraday
making for him a fly-cage and a paper purse, which had a
real bright half-crown in it. When the present Mr. Baden
Powell was a little fellow of thirteen, he used to give
short lectures on chemistry in his father's house, and the
philosopher of Albemarle Street liked to join the family
audience, and would listen and applaud the experiments
heartily. When one day my wife and I called on him with
our children, he set them playing at hide-and-seek in the
lecture theatre, and afterwards amused them upstairs with
tuning-forks and resounding glasses. At a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i> at Mr.
Justice Grove's, he wanted to see the younger children
of the family; so the eldest daughter brought down the
little ones in their nightgowns to the foot of the stairs,
and Faraday expressed his gratification with "Ah! that's the
best thing you have done to-night." And when his faculties
had nearly faded, it is remembered how the stroking of his
hand by Mr. Vincent's little daughter quickened him again
to bright and loving interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply illustrations of this kindliness
in various relations of life.</p>

<p>Here is one of his own telling, where certainly the effect
produced was not owing to any knowledge of how princely
an intellect underlay the loving spirit. It is from a journal
of his tour in Wales:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Tuesday, July 20th.</em>&mdash;After dinner I set off on a ramble
to Melincourt, a waterfall on the north side of the valley,
and about six miles from our inn. Here I got a little
damsel for my guide who could not speak a word of
English. We, however, talked together all the way to the
fall, though neither knew what the other said. I was
delighted with her burst of pleasure as, on turning a
corner, she first showed me the waterfall. Whilst I was
admiring the scene, my little Welsh damsel was busy running
about, even under the stream, gathering strawberries.
On returning from the fall I gave her a shilling that I
might enjoy her pleasure: she curtsied, and I perceived
her delight. She again ran before me back to the village,
but wished to step aside every now and then to pull strawberries.
Every bramble she carefully moved out of the
way, and ventured her bare feet to try stony paths, that
she might find the safest for mine. I observed her as
she ran before me, when she met a village companion,
open her hand to show her prize, but without any stoppage,
word, or other motion. When we returned to the
village I bade her good-night, and she bade me farewell,
both by her actions and, I have no doubt, her language
too."</p>

<p>In a letter which Mr. Abel, the Director of the Chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Department of the War Establishment, has sent me, occur
the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Early in 1849 I was appointed, partly through the kind
recommendation of Faraday, to instruct the senior cadets
and a class of artillery officers in the Arsenal, in practical
chemistry. On the occasion of my first attendance at
Woolwich, when, having just reached manhood, I was
about to deliver my first lecture as a recognized teacher,
I was naturally nervous, and was therefore dismayed when
on entering the class-room I perceived Faraday, who,
having come to Woolwich, as usual, to prepare for his
next morning's lecture at the Military Academy, had been
prompted by his kindly feelings to lend me the support
of his presence upon my first appearance among his old
pupils. In a moment Faraday put me completely at my
ease; he greeted me heartily, saying, 'Well, Abel, I have
come to see whether I can assist you;' and suiting
action to word, he bustled about, persisting in helping
me in the arrangement of my lecture-tables,&mdash;and at the
close of my demonstration he followed me from pupil to
pupil, aiding each in his first attempt at manipulation, and
evidently enjoying most heartily the self-imposed duty of
assistant to his young <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>."</p>

<p>Another scientific friend, Mr. W. F. Barrett, writes:&mdash;"My
first interview with Mr. Faraday ten years ago left an
impression upon me I can never forget. Young student
as I then was, thinking chiefly of present work and little
of future prospects, and till then unknown to Mr. Faraday,
judge of my feelings when, taking my hand in both of his,
he said, 'I congratulate you upon choosing to be a <em>philosopher</em>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it is an arduous life, but a noble and a glorious one.
Work hard, and work carefully, and you will have success.'
The sweet yet serious way he said this made the earnestness
of work become a very vivid reality, and led me to
doubt whether I had not dared to undertake too lofty a
pursuit. After this Mr. Faraday never forgot to remember
me in a number of thoughtful and delicate ways. He would
ask me upstairs to his room to describe or show him the
results of any little investigation I might have made: taking
the greatest interest in it all, his pleasure would seem to
equal and thus heighten mine, and then he would add words
of kind suggestion and encouragement. In the same kindly
spirit he has invited me to his house at Hampton Court,
or would ask me to join him at supper after the Friday
evening's lecture. His kindness is further shown by his
giving me a volume of his researches on Chemistry and
Physics, writing therein, 'From his friend Michael Faraday.'
Those who live alone in London, unknown and uncared-for
by any around them, can best appreciate these marks of
attention which Mr. Faraday invariably showed, and not
only to myself, but equally to my fellow-assistant in the
chemical laboratory."</p>

<p>The following instance among many that might be quoted
will illustrate his readiness to take trouble on behalf of
others. When Dr. Noad was writing his "Manual of Electricity,"
a doubt crossed his mind as to whether Sir Snow
Harris's unit jar gave a true measure of the quantity of
electricity thrown into a Leyden jar: he asked Faraday, and
his doubt was confirmed. Shortly afterwards he received
a letter beginning thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Whilst looking over my papers on induction, I
was reminded of our talk about Harris's unit jar, and
recollected that I had given you a result just the <em>reverse</em>
of my old conclusions, and, as I believe, of the truth. I
think the jar <em>is a true measure</em>, so long as the circumstances
of position, &amp;c., are not altered; for its discharge and the
quantity of electricity thus passed on depends on the constant
relation of the balls connected with the inner and
outer surface coating to each other, and is independent of
their joint relation to the machine, battery, &amp;c.... Perhaps
I have not made my view clear, but next time we
meet, remind me of the matter.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Ever truly yours,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>And just a week afterwards Dr. Noad received a second
letter, surmounted by a neat drawing, and describing at great
length experiments that the Professor had since made in
order to place the matter beyond doubt.</p>

<p>And it was not merely for friends and brother <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i>
that he would take trouble. Old volumes of the <cite>Mechanics'
Magazine</cite> bear testimony to the way in which he was asked
questions by people in all parts of the kingdom, and that
he was accustomed to give painstaking answers to such
letters.</p>

<p>"Do to others as you would wish them to do to you,"
was a precept often on his lips. But I have heard that
he was sometimes charged with transgressing it himself,
inasmuch as he took an amount of trouble for other people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which he would have been greatly distressed if they had
taken for him.</p>

<p>His charities were very numerous,&mdash;not to beggars; for
them he had the Mendicity Society's tickets,&mdash;but to those
whose need he knew. The porter of the Royal Institution
has shown me, among his treasured memorials, a large
number of forms for post-office orders, for sums varying
from 5<em>s.</em> to 5<em>l.</em>, which Faraday was in the habit of
sending in that way to different recipients of his thoughtful
bounty. Two or three instances have come to my
knowledge of his having given more considerable sums of
money&mdash;say 20<em>l.</em>&mdash;to persons who he thought would be
benefited by them. In some instances the gift was called
a loan, but he lent "not expecting again," and entered
into the spirit of the injunction, "When thou doest alms,
let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth."</p>

<p>This principle was in fact stated in one of his letters to
a friend: "As a case of distress I shall be very happy to
help you as far as my means allow me in such cases;
but then I never let my name go to such acts, and very
rarely even the initials of my name." His contributions to
the general funds of his Church were kept equally secret.</p>

<p>From all these circumstances, therefore, it is impossible
to gauge the amount of his charitable gifts; but when it is
remembered that for many years his income from different
sources must have been 1,000<em>l.</em> or 1,200<em>l.</em>, that he and
Mrs. Faraday lived in a simple manner&mdash;comfortably, it is
true, but not luxuriously&mdash;and that his whole income was
disposed of in some way, there can be little doubt that
his gifts amounted to several hundred pounds per annum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not in monetary gifts alone that his kindness
to the distressed was shown. Time was spent as freely as
money; and an engrossing scientific research would not be
allowed to stand in the way of his succouring the sorrowful.
Many persons have told me of his self-denying deeds on
behalf of those who were ill, and of his encouraging words.
He had indeed a heart ever ready to sympathize. Thus
meeting once in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court an
old friend who had retired there invalided and was being
drawn about in a Bath chair, he is said to have burst into
tears.</p>

<p>When eight years ago my wife and my only son were
taken away together, and I lay ill of the same fatal disease,
he called at my house, and in spite of remonstrances found
his way into the infected chamber. He would have taken
me by the hand if I had allowed him; and then he sat
a while by my bedside, consoling me with his sympathy and
cheering me with the Christian hope.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that this kindliness took the hearts of
men captive; and this quality was, like mercy, "twice
blessed; it blesseth him that gives, and him that takes."
The feeling awakened in the minds of others by this kindliness
was indeed a source of the purest pleasure to himself;
trifling proofs of interest or love could easily move his
thankfulness; and he richly enjoyed the appreciation of his
scientific labours. This would often break forth in words.
Thus in the middle of a letter to A. De la Rive, principally
on scientific matters, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you remember one hot day, I cannot tell how
many years ago, when I was hot and thirsty in Geneva,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and you took me to your house in the town and gave me
a glass of water and raspberry vinegar? That glass of
drink is refreshing to me still."</p>

<p>Again: "Tyndall, the sweetest reward of my work is
the sympathy and good-will which it has caused to flow
in upon me from all quarters of the world."</p>

<p>But to estimate rightly this amiability of character, it
must be distinctly remembered that it was not that superabundance
of good-nature which renders some men incapable
of holding their own, or rebuking what they know
to be wrong. In proof of this his letters to the spiritualists
might be quoted; but the following have not hitherto seen
the light. They are addressed to two different parties
whose inventions came officially before him.</p>

<p>"You write 'private' on the outside of your official communication,
and 'confidential' within. I will take care to
respect these instructions as far as falls within my duty; but
I can have nothing private or confidential <em>as regards the
Trinity House</em>, which is my chief. Whatever opinion I send
to them I must accompany with the papers you send me.
If therefore you wish anything held back from them, send
me another official answer, and I will return you the one
I have, marked 'confidential.' Our correspondence is
indeed likely to become a little irregular, because your
papers have not come to me through the Trinity House.
You will feel that I cannot communicate any opinion I
may form to you: I am bound to the Trinity House, to
whom I must communicate in confidence. I have no
objection to your knowing my conclusions; but the <cite>Trinity
House</cite> is the fit judge of the use it may make of them, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the degree of confidence they may think they deserve, or
the parties to whom they may choose to communicate them."</p>

<p>By a foot-note it appears that the <em>private and confidential</em>
communication was returned to the writer, by desire, four
days afterwards.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have received your note and read your pamphlet.
There is nothing in either which makes it at all
desirable to me to see your apparatus, for I have not time
to spare to look at a matter two or three times over. In
referring to &mdash;&mdash;, I suppose you refer also to his application
to the Trinity House. In that case I shall hear from him
<em>through the Trinity House</em>. He has, however, certain inquiries
(which I have no doubt have gone to him long ago
through the Trinity House) to answer before I shall think it
necessary to take any further steps in the matter. With
these, however, I suppose you have nothing to do.</p>

<p>"Are you aware that many years ago our Institution was
lighted up for months, if not for years together, by oil-gas
(or, as you call it, olefiant gas), compressed into cylinders
to the extent of thirty atmospheres, and brought to us from
a distance? I have no idea that the patent referred to at
the bottom of page 9 could stand for an hour in a court of
law. I think, too, you are wrong in misapplying the word
<em>olefiant</em>. It already belongs to a particular gas, and cannot,
without confusion, be used as you use it.</p>

<p class="center">"I am Sir,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Your obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Thanks for your letter. At the close of it you
ask me <em>privately</em> and confidingly for the encouragement my
opinion might give you if <em>this power</em> gas-light is fit for
lighthouses. I am unable to assent to your request, as my
position at the Trinity House requires that I should be able
to take up any subject, applications, or documents they
may bring before me in a perfectly unbiassed condition
of mind.</p>

<p class="center">"I am, Sir,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The kindliness which shed its genial radiance on every
worthy object around, glowed most warmly on the domestic
hearth. Little expressions in his writings often reveal it, as
when we read in his Swiss journal about Interlaken: "Clout-nail
making goes on here rather considerably, and is a very
neat and pretty operation to observe. I love a smith's shop,
and anything relating to smithery. My father was a smith."</p>

<p>When he was sitting to Noble for his bust, it happened
one day that the sculptor, in giving the finishing touches to
the marble, made a clattering with his chisels: noticing that
his sitter appeared <em>distrait</em>, he said that he feared the
jingling of the tools had annoyed him, and that he was
weary. "No, my dear Mr. Noble," said Faraday, putting
his hand on his shoulder, "but the noise reminded me of
my father's anvil, and took me back to my boyhood."</p>

<p>This deep affection peeps out constantly in his letters to
different members of his family, "bound up together," as
he wrote to his sister-in-law, "in the one hope, and in faith
and love which is in Jesus Christ." But it was towards his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wife that his love glowed most intensely. Yet how can we
properly speak of this sacred relationship, especially as the
mourning widow is still amongst us? It may suffice to
catch the glimpse that is reflected in the following extract
from a letter he wrote to Mrs. Andrew Crosse on the death
of her husband:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<em>July 12, 1855.</em></p>

<p>"... Believe that I sympathize with you most deeply,
for I enjoy in my life-partner those things which you speak
of as making you feel your loss so heavily.</p>

<p>"It is the kindly domestic affections, the worthiness, the
mutual aid in sorrow, the mutual joy in happiness that has
existed, which makes the rupture of such a tie as yours so
heavy to bear; and yet you would not wish it otherwise,
for the remembrance of those things brings solace with the
grief. I speak, thinking what my own trouble would be if
I lost my partner; and I try to comfort you in the only way
in which I think I could be comforted.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was, as Tyndall has observed, a mixture of chivalry
with this affection. In his book of diplomas he made the
following remarkable entry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<em>25th January, 1847</em>.</p>

<p>"Amongst these records and events, I here insert the
date of one which, as a source of honour and happiness,
far exceeds all the rest. We were <em>married</em> on June 12,
1821.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>On the character of Faraday, these two qualities of
reverence and kindliness have appeared to me singularly
influential. Among the ways in which they manifested
themselves was that beautiful combination of firmness and
gentleness which has been frequently remarked: intimately
associated with them also were his simplicity and truthfulness.
These points must have made themselves evident
already, but they deserve further illustration.</p>

<p>In his early days, "one Sabbath morning his swift and
sober steps were carrying him along the Holborn pavement
towards his meeting-house, when some small missile
struck him smartly on the hat. He would have thought it
an accident and passed on, when a second and a third rap
caused him to turn and look just in time to perceive a face
hastily withdrawn from a window in the upper story of a
closed linendraper's establishment. Roused by the affront,
he marched up to the door and rapped. The servant
opening it said there was no one at home, but Faraday
declared he knew better, and desired to be shown upstairs.
Opposition still being made, he pushed on, made his way
up through the house, opened the door of an upper room,
discovering a party of young drapers' assistants, who at once
professed they knew nothing of the motive of this sudden
visit. But the hunter had now run his game to earth: he
taxed them sharply with their annoyance of wayfarers on the
Sabbath, and said that unless an apology were made at once,
they should hear from their employer of something much
to their disadvantage. An apology was made forthwith."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Long, long after this event, Dr. and Mrs. Faraday, with
Dr. Tyndall, were returning one evening from Mr. Gassiot's,
on Clapham Common: a dense fog came on, and they did
not know where they were. The two gentlemen got out of
their vehicle, and walked to a house and knocked. A man
appeared, first at a window and afterwards at the door, very
angry indeed at the disturbance, and demanded to know
their business. Faraday, in his calm, irresistible manner,
explained the situation and their object in knocking. The
man instantly changed his tone, looked foolish, and muttered
something about being in a fright lest his house of
business was on fire.</p>

<p>As to simplicity of character: when, in the course of
writing this book, I have spoken to his acquaintances about
Faraday, the most frequent comment has been in such
words as, "Oh! he was a beautiful character, and so simple-minded."
I have tried to ascertain the cause of this simple-mindedness,
and I believe it was the consciousness that he
was meaning to do right himself, and the belief that others
whom he addressed meant to do right too, and so he
could just let them see everything that was passing through
his mind. And while he knew no reason for concealment,
there was no trace of self-conceit about him, nor any pretence
at being what he was not. To illustrate this quality is
not so easy; the indications of it, like his humour, were
generally too delicate to be transferred to paper; but perhaps
the following letter will do as well as anything else, for
there are few philosophers who could have written so
naturally about the pleasures of a pantomime and then
about his highest hopes:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution, London, W.</span></p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"<em>1st January, 1857.</em></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Coutts</span>,</p>

<p>"You are very kind to think of our pleasure and
send us entrance to your box for to-morrow night. We
thank you very sincerely, and I mean to enjoy it, for I still
have a sympathy with children and all their thoughts and
pleasure. Permit me to wish you very sincerely a happy
year; and also to Mrs. Brown. With some of us our
greatest happiness will be content mingled with patience;
but there is much happiness in that and the expected end.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Ever your obliged Servant,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As to truthfulness: he was not only truthful in the common
acceptation of the word, but he did not allow, either in
himself or others, hasty conclusions, random assertions, or
slippery logic. "At such times he had a way of repeating
the suspicious statement very slowly and distinctly, with an
air of wondering scrutiny as if it had astonished him. His
irony was then irresistible, and always produced a modification
of the objectionable phrase."</p>

<p>One Friday evening there was exhibited an improved
Davy lamp, with an eulogistic description. Faraday added
the words, "The opinion of the inventor."</p>

<p>"An acquaintance rather given to inflict tedious narratives
on his friends was descanting to Faraday on the iniquity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
some coachman who had set him down the previous night
in the middle of a dark and miry road,&mdash;'in fact,' said the
irksome drawler, 'in a perfect morass; and there I was, as
you may imagine, half the night, plunging and struggling to
get out of this dreadful morass.' 'More ass you!' rapped
out the philosopher at the top of his scale of laughter."
This was a rare instance, for it was only when much
provoked that he would perpetrate a pun, or depart from
the kind courtesy of his habitual talk.</p>

<p>That he was quite ready to give up a statement or view
when it was proved by others to be incorrect, is shown by
the Preface to the volumes in which are reprinted his
"Experimental Researches." "In giving advice," says his
niece Miss Reid, "he always went back to first principles,
to the true right and wrong of questions, never allowing
deviations from the simple straightforward path of duty to
be justified by custom or precedent; and he judged himself
strictly by the same rule which he laid down for others."</p>

<p>These beauties of character were not marred by serious
defects or opposing faults. "He could not be too closely
approached. There were no shabby places or ugly comers
in his mind." Yet he was very far from being one of those
passionless men who resemble a cold statue rather than
throbbing flesh and blood. He was no "model of all the
virtues," dreadfully uninteresting, and discouraging to those
who feel such calm perfection out of their reach. His
inner life was a battle, with its wounds as well as its
victory. Proud by nature, and quick-tempered, he must
have found the curb often necessary; but notwithstanding
the rapidity of his actions and thoughts, he knew how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
keep a tight rein on that fiery spirit.</p>

<p>I have listened attentively to every remark in disparagement
of Faraday's character, but the only serious ones
have appeared to me to arise from a misunderstanding of
the man, a misunderstanding the more easy because his
standard of right and wrong, and of his own duty, often differed
from the notions current around him. Still, it may be
true that his extreme sensitiveness led him sometimes to do
scant justice to those who, he imagined, were treading too
closely in his own footsteps; as, for instance, when Nobili
brought out some beautiful experiments on magnetism, just
after the short notice of his own discoveries in 1831 which
Faraday had sent to M. Hachette, and which was communicated
to the Académie des Sciences. It is true also
that, with his great caution and his repugnance to moral
evil, he was more disposed to turn away in disgust from an
erring companion than to endeavour to reclaim him. It
has also been imputed to him as a fault that he founded no
school, and took no young man by the hand as Davy had
taken him. That this was rather his misfortune than his
fault, would appear from words he once wrote to Miss
Moore: "I have often endeavoured to discover a genius,
but have not been very successful, though many cases
seemed promising at first." The world would doubtless
have been the gainer if he had stamped his own image on
the minds of a group of disciples: but a man cannot do
everything; and had Faraday been more of a teacher, he
would perhaps have been less of an investigator.</p>

<p>Of course Faraday was subject, like other men, to errors
of judgment, and it was impossible, even if desirable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
always to avoid giving offence. Thus he was constantly
pestered for his autograph; and instead of throwing the
applications into his waste-paper basket, he had a formal
circular lithographed excusing himself from complying.
This offended more than one recipient; and he was roughly
made aware of it by once having the circular returned
from St. Louis with a scurrilous comment, and the postage
from America not prepaid. He never again used the printed
form, Miss Barnard undertaking to answer all such requests.</p>

<p>It has been previously remarked that Faraday took little
part in social movements, and went little into society, but it
must not be supposed that he was by any means unsocial.
It seems probable that his freedom in this matter was
somewhat hampered by the principles in which he had been
brought up: it is certain that he was restrained by the
desire to give all the time and energy he could to scientific
research. Yet pleasant stories are told of his occasional
appearances at social gatherings. Thus he liked to attend
the Royal Academy dinners, and in earlier days he enjoyed
the artistic and musical <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">conversaziones</i> at Hullmandel's,
where Stanfield Turner and Landseer met Garcia and
Malibran; and sometimes he joined this pleasant company
at supper and charades, at others in their excursions up the
river in an eight-oared cutter. Captain Close has described
to me how, when the French Lighthouse authorities put up
the screw-pile light on the sands near Calais, they invited
the Trinity House officers and Faraday to inspect it. A
dinner was arranged for them after the inspection, and M.
Reynaud proposed the health of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étranger célèbre</i>. A
young engineer took exception to Faraday being called a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
stranger&mdash;since he had been at St. Cyr he had known the
great Englishman well by his works. The Professor replied
to the compliment in the language of his hosts, with a few
of his happy and kindly remarks. A gentleman high in the
diplomatic service, who was present, remarked that Faraday
had said many things which were not French, but not a
word which ought not to be so.</p>

<p>More unrestricted was Faraday's sympathy with Nature.
He felt the poetry of the changing seasons, but there were
two aspects of Nature that especially seemed to claim communion
with his spirit: he delighted in a thunderstorm,
and he experienced a pleasurable sadness as the orange
sunset faded into the evening twilight. There are other
minds to which both these sensations are familiar, but they
seem to have been felt with great intensity by him. No
doubt his electrical knowledge added much to his interest
in the grand discharges from the thunder-clouds, but it will
hardly account for his standing long at a window watching
the vivid flashes, a stranger to fear, with his mind full of
lofty thoughts, or perhaps of high communings. Sometimes,
too, if the storm was at a little distance, he would
summon a cab, and, in spite of the pelting rain, drive to
the scene of awful beauty.</p>

<p>On a clear starry night Captain Close quoted to him the
words of Lorenzo in the "Merchant of Venice:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">... "Look, how the floor of heaven</div>
<div class="verse">Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;</div>
<div class="verse">There's not the smallest orb, which thou behold'st,</div>
<div class="verse">But in his motion like an angel sings,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;</div>
<div class="verse">Such harmony is in immortal souls;</div>
<div class="verse">But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay</div>
<div class="verse">Doth grossly close us in, we cannot hear it."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Faraday, who happened not to be familiar with the
passage, made his friend repeat it over and over again as
he drank in the whole meaning of the poetry, for there is a
true sense in which no other mortal had ever opened his
ears so fully to the harmony of the universe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the plains of mental mediocrity there occasionally
rise the mountains of genius, and from the dead level of
selfish respectability there stand out now and then the peaks
of moral greatness. Neither kind of excellence is so common
as we could wish it, and it is a rare coincidence when,
as in Socrates, the two meet in the same individual. In
Faraday we have a modern instance. There are persons
now living who watched this man of strong will and intense
feelings raising himself from the lower ranks of society, yet
without losing his balance; rather growing in simplicity,
disinterestedness, and humility, as princes became his correspondents
and all the learned bodies of the world vied
with each other to do him homage; still finding his greatest
happiness at home, though reigning in the affections of all
his fellows,&mdash;loving every honest man, however divergent in
opinion, and loved most by those who knew him best.</p>

<p>This is the phenomenon. By what theory is it to be
accounted for?</p>

<p>The secret did not lie in the nature of his pursuits. This
cannot be better shown than in the following incident furnished
me by Mrs. Crosse:&mdash;"One morning, a few months
after we were married, my husband took me to t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>he Royal
Institution to call on Mr. and Mrs. Faraday. I had not
seen the laboratory there, and the philosopher very kindly
took us over the Institution, explaining for my information
many objects of interest. His great vivacity and cheeriness
of manner surprised me in a man who devoted his life to
such abstruse studies, but I have since learnt to know that
the highest philosophical nature is often, indeed generally,
united with an almost childlike simplicity.</p>

<p>"After viewing the ample appliances for experimental
research, and feeling impressed by the scientific atmosphere
of the place, I turned and said, 'Mr. Faraday, you must be
very happy in your position and with your pursuits, which
elevate you entirely out of the meaner aspects and lower
aims of common life.'</p>

<p>"He shook his head, and with that wonderful mobility
of countenance which was characteristic, his expression of
joyousness changed to one of profound sadness, he replied:
'When I quitted business, and took to science as
a career, I thought I had left behind me all the petty meannesses
and small jealousies which hinder man in his moral
progress; but I found myself raised into another sphere,
only to find poor human nature just the same everywhere&mdash;subject
to the same weaknesses and the same self-seeking,
however exalted the intellect.'</p>

<p>"These were his words as well as I can recollect; and,
looking at that good and great man, I thought I had never
seen a countenance which so impressed me with the characteristic
of perfect unworldliness. We know how his
life proved that this rare qualification was indeed his."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>"Childlike simplicity:" "unworldliness." Where was
the tree rooted that bore such beautiful blossoms? Faraday
had learnt in the school of Christ to become "a little child,"
and he loved not the world because the love of the Father
was in him.</p>

<p>We have a charming glimpse of this in an extract which
Professor Tyndall has given from an old paper in which he
wrote his impressions after one of his earliest dinners with
the philosopher:&mdash;"At two o'clock he came down for me.
He, his niece, and myself formed the party. 'I never give
dinners,' he said; 'I don't know how to give dinners; and
I never dine out. But I should not like my friends to
attribute this to a wrong cause. I act thus for the sake of
securing time for work, and not through religious motives
as some imagine.' He said grace. I am almost ashamed
to call his prayer a 'saying' of grace. In the language of
Scripture, it might be described as the petition of a son into
whose heart God had sent the Spirit of His Son, and who
with absolute trust asked a blessing from his father. We
dined on roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and potatoes, drank
sherry, talked of research and its requirements, and of his
habit of keeping himself free from the distractions of society.
He was bright and joyful&mdash;boylike, in fact, though he is
now sixty-two. His work excites admiration, but contact
with him warms and elevates the heart. Here, surely, is
a strong man. I love strength, but let me not forget the
example of its union with modesty, tenderness, and
sweetness, in the character of Faraday."</p>

<p>But his religion deserves a closer attention. When an
errand-boy, we find him hurrying the delivery of his newspapers
on a Sunday morning so as to get home in time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
make himself neat to go with his parents to chapel: his
letters when abroad indicate the same disposition; yet he
did not make any formal profession of his faith till a month
after his marriage, when nearly thirty years of age. Of his
spiritual history up to that period little is known, but there
seem to be good grounds for believing that he did not accept
the religion of his fathers without a conscientious inquiry
into its truth. It would be difficult to conceive of his
acting otherwise. But after he joined the Sandemanian
Church, his questionings were probably confined to matters
of practical duty; and to those who knew him best nothing
could appear stronger than his conviction of the reality of
the things he believed. In order to understand the life and
character of Faraday, it is necessary to bear in mind not
merely that he was a Christian, but that he was a Sandemanian.
From his earliest years that religious system
stamped its impress deeply on his mind, it surrounded
the blacksmith's son with an atmosphere of unusual purity
and refinement, it developed the unselfishness of his nature,
and in his after career it fenced his life from the worldliness
around, as well as from much that is esteemed as good by
other Christian bodies. To this small self-contained sect
he clung with warm attachment; he was precluded from
Christian communion or work outside their circle, but his
sympathies at least burst all narrow bounds. Thus the
Abbé Moigno tells us that at Faraday's request he one day
introduced him to Cardinal Wiseman. The interview was
very cordial, and his Eminence did not hesitate frankly and
good-naturedly to ask Faraday if, in his deepest conviction,
he believed all the Church of Christ, holy, catholic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
apostolical, was shut up in the little sect in which he bore
rule. "Oh no!" was the reply; "but I do believe from
the bottom of my soul that Christ is with us." There
were other points, too, in his character which reflected the
colouring of the religious school to which he belonged.
Thus, while humility is inseparable from a Christian life,
there is a special phase of that virtue bred of those doctrines
which teach that all our righteousness must be the unmerited
gift of another: these doctrines are strongly insisted upon in
the Sandemanian Church, and this humility was acquired in
an intense degree by its minister. Again, while all Christians
deplore the terrible amount of folly and sin in the world,
most recognize also a large amount of good, and believe in
progressive improvement; but small communities are apt to
take gloomy views, and so did Faraday, notwithstanding his
personal happiness, and his firm conviction that "there is
One above who worketh in all things, and who governs even
in the midst of that misrule to which the tendencies and
powers of men are so easily perverted."</p>

<p>In writing to Professor Schönbein and a few other kindred
spirits he would turn naturally enough from scientific
to religious thoughts, and back again to natural philosophy,
but he generally kept these two departments of his mental
activity strangely distinct; yet of course it was well known
that the Professor at Albemarle Street was one of that
long line of scientific men, beginning with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> of
the East, who have brought to the Redeemer the gold,
frankincense, and myrrh of their adoration.</p>

<p>But the peculiar features of Faraday's spiritual life are
matters of minor importance: the genuineness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
religious character is acknowledged by all. We have
admired his faithfulness, his amiability of disposition, and
his love of justice and truth; how far these qualities were
natural gifts, like his clearness of intellect, we cannot
precisely tell; but that he exercised constant self-control
without becoming hard, ascended the pathway of fame
without ever losing his balance, and shed around himself
a peculiar halo of love and joyousness, must be attributed
in no small degree to a heart at peace with God, and to
the consciousness of a higher life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="no-break">SECTION III.<br />

<span class="medfont">FRUITS OF HIS EXPERIENCE.</span></h2>

<p>Those who loved Faraday would treasure every word that
he wrote, and to them the life and letters which Bence
Jones has given to the world will be inestimable; but
from the multitude who knew him only at a distance, we
can expect no enthusiasm of admiration. Yet all will
readily believe that through the writings of such a genius
there must be scattered nuggets of intellectual gold, even
when he is not treating directly of scientific subjects.
Some of these relate to questions of permanent interest,
and such nuggets it is my aim to separate and lay before
the reader.</p>

<p>When quite a young man he drew the following ideal
portrait:&mdash;"The philosopher should be a man willing to
listen to every suggestion, but determined to judge for himself.
He should not be biassed by appearances, have no
favourite hypothesis, be of no school, and in doctrine have
no master. He should not be a respecter of persons, but
of things. Truth should be his primary object. If to
these qualities be added industry, he may indeed hope to
walk within the veil of the temple of Nature." This ideal
he must steadily have kept before him, and not unfrequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>ly
in after days he gave utterance to similar
thoughts. Here are two instances, the first from a lecture
thirty years afterwards, the second from a private letter:&mdash;"We
may be <em>sure</em> of facts, but our interpretation of facts
we should doubt. He is the wisest philosopher who holds
his theory with some doubt; who is able to proportion his
judgment and confidence to the value of the evidence set
before him, taking a fact for a fact, and a supposition for
a supposition; as much as possible keeping his mind free
from all source of prejudice, or, where he cannot do this
(as in the case of a theory), remembering that such a source
is there." The letter is to Mr. Frederick Field, and relates
to a paper on the existence of silver in the water of the
ocean.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>21st October, 1856</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Your paper looks so well, that though I am of
course unable to become security for the facts, I have
still thought it my duty to send it to the Royal Society.
Whether it will appear there or not I cannot say,&mdash;no one
can say even for his own papers; but for my part, I think
that as facts are the foundation of science, however they
may be interpreted, so they are most valuable, and often
more so than the interpretations founded upon them. I
hope your further researches will confirm those you have
obtained: but I would not be too hasty with them,&mdash;rather
wait a while, and make them quite secure.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"I am, Sir, your obliged Servant,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>How pleasant it would have been to peep into his mind
and watch the process by which he was transformed into
the very image of his ideal philosopher! He has partially
told us the secret in two remarkable lectures, one of which
was delivered before the City Philosophical Society when
he was only twenty-seven years of age, while the other
formed part of a series on Education at Albemarle Street.
Copious extracts from the first are given by Dr. Bence
Jones; the second was published at the time. In the early
lecture, which is "On the Forms of Matter," he points out
the advantages and dangers of systematizing, and winds up
his remarks with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nothing is more difficult and requires more care than
philosophical deduction, nor is there anything more adverse
to its accuracy than fixidity of opinion. The man who is
certain he is right is almost sure to be wrong, and he has
the additional misfortune of inevitably remaining so. All
our theories are fixed upon uncertain data, and all of them
want alteration and support. Ever since the world began
opinion has changed with the progress of things; and it is
something more than absurd to suppose that we have a
sure claim to perfection, or that we are in possession of the
highest stretch of intellect which has or can result from
human thought. Why our successors should not displace
us in our opinions, as well as in our persons, it is difficult
to say; it ever has been so, and from analogy would be
supposed to continue so; and yet, with all this practical
evidence of the fallibility of our opinions, all, and none
more than philosophers, are ready to assert the real truth
of their opinions."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>In his discourse entitled "Observations on Mental
Education," like a skilful physician he first determines what
is the great intellectual disease from which the community
suffers&mdash;"deficiency of judgment,"&mdash;and then he lays down
rules by which each man may attempt his own cure. For
this self-education, "it is necessary that a man examine
himself, and that not carelessly.... A first result of this
habit of mind will be an internal conviction of <em>ignorance in
many things respecting which his neighbours are taught</em>, and
that his opinions and conclusions on such matters ought to
be advanced with reservation. A mind so disciplined will
be <em>open to correction upon good grounds in all things</em>, even in
those it is best acquainted with; and should familiarize
itself with the idea of such being the case.... It is right
that we should stand by and act on our principles, but not
right to hold them in obstinate blindness, or retain them
when proved to be erroneous." And then he gives cases
from his own mental history:&mdash;"I remember the time when
I believed a spark was produced between voltaic metals as
they approached to contact (and the reasons why it might
be possible yet remain); but others doubted the fact and
denied the proofs, and on re-examination I found reason
to admit their corrections were well founded. Years ago
I believed that electrolites could conduct electricity by a
conduction proper; that has also been denied by many
through long time: though I believed myself right, yet
circumstances have induced me to pay that respect to
criticism as to re-investigate the subject, and I have the
pleasure of thinking that nature confirms my original
conclusions. So, though evidence may appear to preponderate
extremely in favour of a certain decision, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wise and proper to hear a counter-statement. You can
have no idea how often, and how much, under such an impression,
I have desired that the marvellous descriptions
which have reached me might prove, in some points, correct;
and how frequently I have submitted myself to hot
fires, to friction with magnets, to the passes of hands, &amp;c.,
lest I should be shutting out discovery;&mdash;encouraging the
strong desire that something might be true, and that I
might aid in the development of a new force of nature."
He turns then to another evil, and its cure: "The <em>tendency
to deceive ourselves</em> regarding all we wish for, and the
necessity of <em>resistance to these desires</em>; ... the force of the
temptation which urges us to seek for such evidence and
appearances as are in favour of our desires, and to disregard
those which oppose them, is wonderfully great. In
this respect we are all, more or less, active promoters of
error." He winds up his remarks upon this subject with
the italicized sentence: "I will simply express my strong
belief that that point of self-education which consists in
teaching the mind to resist its desires and inclinations until
they are proved to be right, is the most important of all,
not only in things of natural philosophy, but in every department
of daily life." He turns then to the necessity of
a "habit of forming clear and precise ideas," and of expressing
them in "clear and definite language:"&mdash;"When
the different data required are in our possession, and we
have succeeded in forming a clear idea of each, the mind
should be instructed to <em>balance them</em> one against another,
and not suffered carelessly to hasten to a conclusion." "As
a result of this wholesome mental condition, we should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
able to form a <em>proportionate judgment</em>;" that is, one proportionate
to the evidence, ranging through all degrees of probability&mdash;while
he adds: "Frequently the exercise of the
judgment ought to end in <em>absolute reservation</em>."</p>

<p>"The education which I advocate," says Faraday, "will
require <em>patience</em> and <em>labour of thought</em> in every exercise
tending to improve the judgment. It matters not on what
subject a person's mind is occupied; he should engage in
it with the conviction that it will require mental labour."
"Because the education is internal, it is not the less needful;
nor is it more the duty of a man that he should cause
his child to be taught, than that he should teach himself.
Indolence may tempt him to neglect the self-examination
and experience which form his school, and weariness may
induce the evasion of the necessary practices; but surely a
thought of the prize should suffice to stimulate him to the
requisite exertion; and to those who reflect upon the many
hours and days devoted by a lover of sweet sounds to gain
a moderate facility upon a mere mechanical instrument, it
ought to bring a correcting blush of shame if they feel
convicted of neglecting the beautiful living instrument
wherein play all the powers of the mind."</p>

<p>At the commencement of this discourse the lecturer
felt called upon to limit the range of his remarks:&mdash;"High
as man is placed above the creatures around him, there is a
higher and far more exalted position within his view; and
the ways are infinite in which he occupies his thoughts
about the fears, or hopes, or expectations of a future life.
I believe that the truth of that future cannot be brought to
his knowledge by any exertion of his mental powers, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
exalted they may be; that it is made known to him by
other teaching than his own, and is received through simple
belief of the testimony given. Let no one suppose for a
moment that the self-education I am about to commend
in respect of the things of this life extends to any considerations
of the hope set before us, as if man by reasoning
could find out God. It would be improper here to enter
upon this subject further than to claim an absolute distinction
between religious and ordinary belief. I shall be
reproached with the weakness of refusing to apply those
mental operations which I think good in respect of high
things to the very highest. I am content to bear the
reproach. Yet, even in earthly matters, I believe that 'the
invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
even His eternal power and Godhead;' and I have never
seen anything incompatible between those things of man
which can be known by the spirit of man which is within
him, and those higher things concerning his future which he
cannot know by that spirit." There is of course a certain
truth in this passage; spiritual discernment is a real thing
possessed by some, and not by others; yet is there this
absolute distinction between religious and ordinary belief?
Surely there is the same opportunity and the same necessity
for careful judgment, and for resistance to prejudice or
preference, when we are weighing the credentials of anything
that may come before us purporting to be a revelation
from above; surely too, if we have satisfied ourselves that
we possess such a revelation, we must seek for the same
clearness of ideas, and must exercise the same patience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> and
labour of thought, if we would understand it aright. That
mental discipline which fits us to interpret the works of
God cannot but be akin to the intellectual training required
for interpreting His word.</p>

<p>Since Faraday thought and wrote, the question of public
education has taken a far deeper hold on the feelings and
the hopes of the nation, and it is not merely the extent of
the instruction, but its nature also, that is discussed. It is
held to be no longer right that the minds of our youth
should be fed almost exclusively on the dry husks of classic
or mediæval knowledge, while the rich banquet of modern
discovery remains untasted. Yet it is hard for natural
science to gain an honoured place in our venerable scholastic
institutions. Faraday, however, had long formed his
conclusions on this subject. In one of his Friday evening
discourses he says: "The development of the applications
of physical science in modern times has become so large and
so essential to the well-being of man, that it may justly be
used as illustrating the true character of pure science as a
department of knowledge, and the claims it may have for
consideration by Governments, Universities, and all bodies
to whom is confided the fostering care and direction of
learning. As a branch of learning, men are beginning to
recognize the right of science to its own particular place;
for, though flowing in channels utterly different in their
course and end from those of literature, it conduces not
less, as a means of instruction, to the discipline of the
mind, whilst it ministers, more or less, to the wants,
comforts, and proper pleasure, both mental and bodily, of
every individual of every class in life. Until of late ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>ars,
the education for, and recognition of it by the bodies
which may be considered as governing the general course
of all education, have been chiefly directed to it only as
it could serve professional services, viz. those which are
remunerated by society; but now the fitness of university
degrees in science is under consideration, and many are
taking a high view of it, as distinguished from literature,
and think that it may well be studied for its own sake, <em>i.e.</em>
as a proper exercise of the human intelligence, able to
bring into action and development all the powers of the
mind. As a branch of learning, it has (without reference
to its applications) become as extensive and varied as
literature; and it has this privilege, that it must ever go on
increasing."</p>

<p>On the subject of scientific education Faraday was
examined by the Public Schools Commission, November
18th, 1862, and his sentiments of course appear in their
report. He said to them: "That the natural knowledge
which has been given to the world in such abundance
during the last fifty years should remain untouched, and that
no sufficient attempt should be made to convey it to the
young mind growing up and obtaining its first views of
those things, is to me a matter so strange that I find it
difficult to understand. Though I think I see the opposition
breaking away, it is yet a very hard one to overcome.
That it ought to be overcome I have not the least doubt in
the world." Lord Clarendon asked him: "You think it is
now knocking at the door, and there is a prospect of the
door being opened?" "Yes," answered Faraday, "and it
will make its way, or we shall stay behind other nat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>ions in
our mode of education." He had been led to the conviction
that the exclusive attention to literary studies created
a tendency to regard other things as nonsense, or belonging
only to the artisan, and so the mind is positively injured for
the reception of real knowledge. He says: "It is the
highly educated man that we find coming to us again and
again, and asking the most simple question in chemistry or
mechanics; and when we speak of such things as the
conservation of force, the permanency of matter, and the
unchangeability of the laws of nature, they are far from
comprehending them, though they have relation to us in
every action of our lives. Many of these instructed persons
are as far from having the power of judging of these things
as if their minds had never been trained."</p>

<p>He gives his own opinion as to the precise course to be
pursued with great diffidence; but it is evident that he
would begin the education in natural science at a pretty
early age, and in all cases carry it up to a certain point.
One-fifth of a boy's time might be devoted to this purpose
at present, though in less than half a century he thinks
science will deserve and obtain a far larger share. Supposing
a boy of eleven years of age and of ordinary intelligence
at one of our public schools: "I would teach him,"
he says, "all those things that come before classics in the
programme of the London University,&mdash;mechanics, hydrostatics,
hydraulics, pneumatics, acoustics, and optics. They
are very simple and easily understood when they are looked
at with attention by both man and boy. With a candle, a
lamp, and a lens or two, an intelligent instructor might teach
optics in a very short time; and so with chemistry. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
should desire all these." Much would depend on the competency
and earnestness of the teacher. "Good lectures
might do a great deal. They would at all events remove
the absolute ignorance which sometimes now appears, but
would give a very poor knowledge of natural things."</p>

<p>Perhaps these opinions of one whose lips are now silent
will yet have their weight in the discussion of this question
both in our highest seats of learning and in those educational
parliaments which have been lately called into existence
in almost every town and district of our country.</p>

<p>From the somewhat disparaging remarks about lectures
quoted above, it must not be supposed that this prince
of lecturers depreciated his office. "Lectures," he said,
"depend entirely for their value upon the manner in which
they are given. It is not the matter, it is not the subject,
so much as the man; but if he is not competent, and does
not feel that there is a need of competency, to convey his
ideas gently and quietly and simply to the young mind, he
simply throws up obstacles, and will be found using words
which they will not comprehend." These were the words of
his later days, but fortunately he felt "the need of competency"
before his own habits were formed, and in four
letters to Abbott we find wonderfully sagacious observations
on the matter, which it would be well for any young lecturer
to study. He describes the proper arrangement of a
lecture-room, dwelling on the necessity of good ventilation;
and then, having considered the fittest subjects for popular
lectures, he turns to the character of the audience, and shows
how that must be studied; for some expect to be entertained
by the manner of the lecturer as well as his subject, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
others care for something which will instruct. He dwells on
the superiority of the eye over the ear as a channel of
knowledge, and lays down some rules for this kind of instruction,
which he of all men subsequently carried out to
perfection. "Apparatus is an essential part of every lecture
in which it can be introduced.... Diagrams and tables, too,
are necessary, or at least add in an eminent degree to the
illustration and perfection of a lecture. When an experimental
lecture is to be delivered, and apparatus is to be exhibited,
some kind of order should be observed in the arrangement
of them on the lecture table. Every particular part
illustrative of the lecture should be in view; no one thing
should hide another from the audience, nor should anything
stand in the way of or obstruct the lecturer. They should
be so placed, too, as to produce a kind of uniformity in
appearance. No one part should appear naked and another
crowded, unless some particular reason exists and makes it
necessary to be so. At the same time the whole should be
so arranged as to keep one operation from interfering with
another." A good delivery comes in for its share of praise;
"for though to all true philosophers science and nature will
have charms innumerable in every dress, yet I am sorry to
say that the generality of mankind cannot accompany us
one short hour unless the path is strewed with flowers."
Then, "a lecturer should appear easy and collected, undaunted
and unconcerned, his thoughts about him, and his
mind clear and free for the contemplation and description
of his subject. His action should not be hasty and violent,
but slow, easy, and natural, consisting principally in changes
of the posture of the body, in order to avoid the air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
stiffness or sameness that would otherwise be unavoidable.
His whole behaviour should evince respect for his audience,
and he should in no case forget that he is in their presence."
He allows a lecturer to prepare his discourse in writing, but
not to read it before the audience, and points out how
necessary it is "to raise their interest at the commencement
of the lecture, and by a series of imperceptible gradations,
unnoticed by the company, keep it alive as long as the
subject demands it." This of course forbids breaks in the
argument, or digressions foreign to the main purpose, and
limits the length of the lecture to a period during which the
listeners can pay unwearied attention. He castigates those
speakers who descend so low as "to angle for claps," or who
throw out hints for commendation, and shows that apologies
should be made as seldom as possible. Experiments should
be to the point, clear, and easily understood: "they should
rather approach to simplicity, and explain the established
principles of the subject, than be elaborate and apply to
minute phenomena only.... 'Tis well, too, when the lecturer
has the ready wit and the presence of mind to turn
any casual circumstance to an illustration of his subject."
But experiments should be explained by a satisfactory theory;
or if the scientific world is divided in opinion, both sides of
the question ought to be stated with the strongest arguments
for each, that justice may be done and honour satisfied.</p>

<p>Often in later days was his experience in lecturing made
use of for the benefit of others. "If," he once remarked to
a young lecturer, "I said to my audience, 'This stone will
fall to the ground if I open my hand,' I should open my
hand and let it fall. Take nothing for granted as known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>;
inform the eye at the same time as you address the ear." I
remember him once giving me hints on the laying of the
lecture table at the Institution, and telling me that where
possible he was accustomed to arrange the apparatus in such
a way as to suggest the order of the experiments. An incident
told me by Dr. Carpenter will illustrate some of the
foregoing points. The first time he heard Faraday lecture
at the Royal Institution, the Professor was explaining the
researches of Melloni on radiant heat. During the discourse
he touched on the refraction and polarization of heat; and
to explain refraction he showed the simple experiment of
fixing some coloured wafers at the bottom of a basin, and
then pouring in water so as to make them apparently rise.
Dr. Carpenter, who had come up from Bristol with grand
ideas of the lectures at Albemarle Street, wondered greatly
at the introduction of so commonplace an experiment. Of
course there were many other illustrations, and beautiful
ones too. He went down, however, after the lecture, to
the table, and among the crowd chatting there was an old
gentleman who remarked, "I think the best experiment
to-night was that of the wafers in the basin."</p>

<p>When a young lecturer, Faraday took lessons in elocution
from Mr. Smart, and was at great pains to cure himself of
any defect of pronunciation or manner; for this purpose he
would get a friendly critic to form part of his audience. On
the fly-leaves of many of the notes of his lectures are
written the reminders&mdash;"Stand up"&mdash;"Don't talk quick."
Indeed, in early days it was so much a matter of anxiety to
him that everything in his lectures should be as perfect as
possible, that he not only was accustomed to go over everyt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>hing
again and again in his mind, but the difficulty
of satisfying himself used to trouble his dreams. I was
told this, if I am not mistaken, by himself; and it goes
far to explain how his discourses possessed such a fascination.</p>

<p>Some of his feelings in regard to lecturing may be learnt
from the following particulars, for which I am indebted to
Mr. Charles Tomlinson. They relate to a course of lectures
he delivered in 1849 on Statical Electricity. The first
lecture began thus:&mdash;"Time moves on, and brings changes
to ourselves as well as to science. I feel that I must soon
resign into the hands of my successors the position which
I now occupy at this table. Indeed, I have long felt how
much rather I would sit among you and be instructed than
stand here and attempt to instruct. I have always felt my
position in this Institution as a very strange one. Coming
after such a man as Davy, and associated with such a man
as Brande, and having had to make a position for myself,
I have always felt myself here in a strange position. You
will wonder why I make these remarks. It is not from any
affectation of modesty that I do so, but I feel that loss of
memory may soon incapacitate me altogether for my duties.
Without, however, troubling you more about myself, let us
proceed to the subject before us, and fall back upon the
beginnings of the wonderful science of electricity. I shall
have to trouble you with very little of theory. The facts are
so wonderful that I shall not attempt to explain them." At
the second lecture, "Faraday advanced to the table at three
o'clock, and began to apologize for an obstruction of voice,
which indeed was painfully evident. He said that, 'in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
engagement where the contracting parties were one and
many, the one ought not on any slight ground to break his
part of the engagement with the many, and therefore, if the
audience would excuse his imperfect utterance, he would endeavour&mdash;'
Murmurs arose: 'Put off the lecture.' Faraday
begged to be allowed to go on. A medical man then
rose and said he had given it as his opinion that it would
be dangerous to Dr. Faraday to proceed. Faraday again
urged his wish to proceed&mdash;said it was giving so much
trouble to the ladies, who had sent away their carriages, and
perhaps put off other engagements. On this the whole
audience rose as by a single impulse, and a number of
persons surrounded Faraday, who now yielded to the general
desire to spare him the pain and inconvenience of lecturing."
A fortnight elapsed before he could again make his
appearance, but he continued his course later than usual,
in order not to deprive his audience of any of the eight
lectures he had undertaken to give them. Prince Albert
came to one of these extra lectures.</p>

<p>Faraday's opinion as to the honours due to scientific men
from society or from Government, may be gathered from
the following extract from a letter written me by his
private friend Mr. Blaikley:&mdash;"On one occasion, when
making some remark in reference to a movement on behalf
of science, I inadvertently spoke of the proper honour due
to science. He at once remarked, 'I am not one who
considers that science can be honoured.' I at once saw
the point. His views of the grandeur of truth, when once
apprehended, raised it far beyond any honour that man
could give it; but man might honour himself by respec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>ting
and acknowledging it."</p>

<p>Professor George Wilson, of Edinburgh, has thus described
his first visit to the philosopher: "Faraday was very
kind, showed me his whole laboratory with labours going
on, and talked frankly and kindly; but to the usual question
of something to do, gave the usual round O answer, and
treated me to a just, but not very cheering animadversion
on the Government of this country, which, unlike that of
every other civilized country, will give no help to scientific
inquiry, and will afford no aid or means of study for
young chemists."</p>

<p>"Take care of your money," was his advice to Mr. Joule,
then another young aspirant to scientific honours, but who
has since rendered the highest service to science, without
leaning on any hopes of Government help or public support.</p>

<p>But the impressions given in conversation may not be
always correct. Happily there exist his written opinions on
this subject. In a letter addressed to Professor Andrews
of Belfast, and dated 2nd February, 1843, there occurs this
passage:&mdash;"As to the particular point of your letter about
which you honour me by asking my advice, I have no
advice to give; but I have a strong feeling in the matter,
and will tell you what I should do. I have always felt that
there is something degrading in offering rewards for intellectual
exertion, and that societies or academies, or even
Kings and Emperors, should mingle in the matter does not
remove the degradation, for the feeling which is hurt is
a point above their condition, and belongs to the respect
which a man owes to himself. With this feeling, I have
never since I was a boy aimed at any such prize; or ev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>en if,
as in your case, they came near me, have allowed them to
move me from my course; and I have always contended
that such rewards will never move the men who are most
worthy of reward. Still, I think rewards and honours <em>good</em>
if properly distributed, but they should be given for what a
man has done, and not offered for what he is to do, or else
talent must be considered as a thing marketable and to be
bought and sold, and then down falls that high tone of
mind which is the best excitement to a man of power, and
will make him do more than any commonplace reward.
When a man is rewarded for his deserts, he honours those
who grant the reward, and they give it not as a moving
impulse to him, but to all those who by the reward are led
to look to that man for an example."</p>

<p>Eleven years afterwards Faraday expressed similar views,
but more fully, in a letter to the late Lord Wrottesley as
chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of the British
Association:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>March 10th, 1854</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>"I feel unfit to give a deliberate opinion on the
course it might be advisable for the Government to pursue
if it were anxious to improve the position of science and its
cultivators in our country. My course of life, and the
circumstances which make it a happy one for me, are not
those of persons who conform to the usages and habits of
society. Through the kindness of all, from my Sovereign
downwards, I have that which supplies all my need; and in
respect of honours, I have, as a scientific man, received
from foreign countries and Sovereigns, those which, belon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>ging
to very limited and select classes, surpass in my opinion
anything that it is in the power of my own to bestow.</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I have not valued such distinctions;
on the contrary, I esteem them very highly, but I do not
think I have ever worked for or sought after them. Even
were such to be now created here, the time is past when
these would possess any attraction for me; and you will see
therefore how unfit I am, upon the strength of any personal
motive or feeling, to judge of what might be influential
upon the minds of others. Nevertheless, I will make one
or two remarks which have often occurred to my mind.</p>

<p>"Without thinking of the effect it might have upon
distinguished men of science, or upon the minds of those
who, stimulated to exertion, might become distinguished, I
do think that a Government should <em>for its own sake</em> honour
the men who do honour and service to the country. I
refer now to honours only, not to beneficial rewards; of
such honours I think there are none. Knighthoods and
baronetcies are sometimes conferred with such intentions,
but I think them utterly unfit for that purpose. Instead of
conferring distinction, they confound the man who is one
of twenty, or perhaps fifty, with hundreds of others. They
depress rather than exalt him, for they tend to lower the
especial distinction of mind to the commonplaces of society.
An intelligent country ought to recognize the scientific men
among its people as a class. If honours are conferred upon
eminence in any class, as that of the law or the army, they
should be in this also. The aristocracy of the class should
have other distinctions than those of lowly and high-born,
rich and poor, yet they should be such as to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
worthy of those whom the Sovereign and the country should
delight to honour, and, being rendered very desirable and
even enviable in the eyes of the aristocracy by birth, should
be unattainable except to that of science. Thus much I
think the Government and the country ought to do, for their
own sake and the good of science, more than for the sake
of the men who might be thought worthy of such distinction.
The latter have attained to their fit place, whether
the community at large recognize it or not.</p>

<p>"But besides that, and as a matter of reward and encouragement
to those who have not yet risen to great distinction, I
think the Government should, in the very many cases which
come before it having a relation to scientific knowledge,
employ men who pursue science, provided they are also men
of business. This is perhaps now done to some extent,
but to nothing like the degree which is practicable with
advantage to all parties. The right means cannot have
occurred to a Government which has not yet learned to
approach and distinguish the class as a whole. * * *</p>

<p class="rightalignindent6">"I have the honour to be, my Lord,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Your very faithful Servant,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes people's views on these matters change
when the despised distinction is actually offered, but it
was not so with him; for once, when indirectly sounded
as to whether a knighthood would be acceptable, he declined
the honour, preferring to "remain plain Michael
Faraday to the last."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>In this day, when so many allow their names to be used
for offices of which they never intended to discharge the
duties, the following letter may convey an appropriate
lesson:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>Oct. 17th, 1849</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Percy</span>,</p>

<p>"I cannot be on the committee; I avoid everything
of that kind, that I may keep my stupid mind a little
clear. As to being on a committee and not working, that
is worse still. * * *</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Ever yours and Mrs. Percy's,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is well known that he waged implacable war with the
Spiritualists. Eighteen years ago tables took to spinning
mysteriously under the fingers of ladies and gentlemen who
sat or stood around the animated furniture; much was said
about a new force, much too about strange revelations from
another sphere, but Faraday made a simple apparatus which
convinced him and most others that the tables moved
through the unconscious pressure of the hands that touched
them. The account of this will be found in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>
of July 2, 1853. Three weeks afterwards he wrote to his
friend Schönbein: "I have not been at work except in
turning the tables upon the table-turners, nor should I have
done that, but that so many inquiries poured in upon me,
that I thought it better to stop the inpouring flood by letting
all know at once what my views and thoughts were. What
a weak, credulous, incredulous, unbelieving, superstitious,
bold, frightened,&mdash;what a ridiculous world ours is, as far as
concerns the mind of man! How full of inconsistencies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
contradictions, and absurdities it is!" But the believers in
these occult phenomena, some of them holding high positions
about the Court, would not let him alone; and there
are many indications of the annoyance and irritation they
caused him. He declined to meet the professors of the
mysterious art, and the following letter will serve to show
the way in which he regarded them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>Nov. 1, 1864</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I beg to thank you for your papers, but have wasted
more thought and time on so-called spiritual manifestation
than it has deserved. Unless the spirits are utterly contemptible,
<em>they</em> will find means to draw my attention.</p>

<p>"How is it that your name is not signed to the testimony
that you give? Are you doubtful even whilst you publish?
I've no evidence that any natural or unnatural power is
concerned in the phenomena that requires investigation or
deserves it. If I could consult the spirits, or move them to
make themselves honestly manifest, I would do it. But I
cannot, and am weary of them.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was once a strange statement put forth to the effect
that Faraday said electricity was life.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He himself denied it
indignantly; but as most falsehoods are perversions of some
truth, this one probably originated in his experiments on the
Gymnotus. He felt an intense interest in those marine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
animals that give shocks, and sought "to identify the living
power which they possess, with that which man can call into
action from inert matter, and by him named electricity."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The most powerful of these is the Gymnotus, or electrical
eel, and a live specimen of this creature, forty inches
long, was secured by the Adelaide Gallery&mdash;a predecessor of
the Polytechnic&mdash;in the summer of 1838. Four days after
its arrival the poor creature lost an eye; for two months
it could not be coaxed to eat either meat or fish, worms or
frogs; but at last one day it killed and devoured four small
fishes, and afterwards swallowed about a fish per diem. It
was accustomed to swim round and round the tank, till
a live fish was dropped in, when in some cases bending
round its victim, it would discharge a shock that made the
fish float on its back stunned and ready to be sucked
into the jaws of its assailant.</p>

<p>Faraday examined this eel and the water around it, both
with his hands and with special collectors of electricity, and
satisfied himself not merely of the shock, which was easy
enough, but of its power to deflect a galvanometer, to make
a magnet, to effect chemical decomposition, and to give a
spark. His account of the experiments terminates with
some speculations on the connection of this animal electricity
with nervous power; but there the matter rested. His own
views were thus expressed to his friend Dumas:&mdash;"As living
creatures produce heat, and a heat certainly identical with
that of our hearths, why should they not produce electricity
also, and an electricity in like manner identical with that of
our machines? But if the heat produced during life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
necessary to life, is not life after all, why should electricity
itself be life? Like heat, like chemical action, electricity is
an implement of life, and nothing more."</p>

<p>Whether the belief that electricity is life would be inconsistent
with the Christian faith or not, it is clear that when
an infidel preacher asserts that Faraday held such an opinion,
his assertion will influence few who are not already disposed
to Materialism. Far more damaging is it to the cause of
religion when her ministers repeat the assumption of the
infidel that those who study the truths of nature are particularly
prone to disbelieve. Yet such statements have
been made, even with reference to Faraday. I have it on
the best authority that one of the leading clergymen of the
day, preaching on a special occasion from Peter's words,
"The elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also
and the works that are therein shall be burned up," spoke
in antagonism to scientific men, alluding to Faraday by
name, and to his computation of the tremendous electrical
forces that would be produced by sundering the elements of
one drop of water. "They shall be confuted by their own
element&mdash;fire," added the preacher, careless of the conclusion
which his audience might legitimately draw from
such a two-edged argument. The accuser of the men of
science was much astonished when told after his sermon,
by a brother clergyman, that Faraday and other eminent
physicists of the day were believers in a divine revelation.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether Faraday ever tried to form a
definite idea of the relation in which the physical forces
stand to the Supreme Intelligence, as Newton did, or his
own friend Sir John Herschel; nor did he consider it par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>t
of his duty as a lecturer to look beyond the natural laws he
was describing. His practice in this respect has been well
described by the Rev. Professor Pritchard:<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;"This great
and good man never obtruded the strength of his faith upon
those whom he publicly addressed; upon principle he was
habitually reticent on such topics, because he believed they
were ill suited for the ordinary assemblages of men. Yet on
more than one occasion when he had been discoursing on
some of the magnificent pre-arrangements of Divine Providence
so lavishly scattered in nature, I have seen him struggle
to repress the emotion which was visibly striving for utterance;
and then, at the last, with one single far-reaching word,
he would just hint at his meaning rather than express it.
On such occasions he only who had ears to hear, could
hear."</p>

<p>In his more familiar lectures to the cadets at Woolwich,
however, he more than hinted at such elevated thoughts.
In conversation, too, Faraday has been known to express
his wonder that anyone should fail to recognize the constant
traces of design; and in his writings there sometimes occur
such passages as the following:&mdash;"When I consider the
multitude of associated forces which are diffused through
nature&mdash;when I think of that calm and tranquil balancing
of their energies which enables elements most powerful in
themselves, most destructive to the world's creatures and
economy, to dwell associated together and be made subservient
to the wants of creation, I rise from the contemplation
more than ever impressed with the wisdom, the beneficence,
and grandeur beyond our language to express, of the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Disposer of all!"</p>

<p>Faraday's journals abound with descriptions of "nature
and human nature." He had evidently a keen eye for the
beauties of scenery, and occasionally the objects around
him suggested higher thoughts. Here are two instances
taken from his notes of a Swiss tour in 1841:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Monday, 19th.</em>&mdash;Very fine day; walk with dear Sarah
on the lake side to Oberhofen, through the beautiful vineyards;
very busy were the women and men in trimming
the vines, stripping off leaves and tendrils from the fruit-bearing
branches. The churchyard was beautiful, and the
simplicity of the little remembrance-posts set upon the
graves very pleasant. One who had been too poor to put
up an engraved brass plate, or even a painted board, had
written with ink on paper the birth and death of the being
whose remains were below, and this had been fastened to
a board, and mounted on the top of a stick at the head
of the grave, the paper being protected by a little edge and
roof. Such was the simple remembrance, but Nature had
added her pathos, for under the shelter by the writing a
caterpillar had fastened itself, and passed into its deathlike
state of chrysalis, and, having ultimately assumed its final
state, it had winged its way from the spot, and had left
the corpse-like relics behind. How old and how beautiful
is this figure of the resurrection! Surely it can never appear
before our eyes without touching the thoughts."</p>

<p>"<em>August 12th, Brienz Lake.</em>&mdash;George and I crossed the
lake in a boat to the Giessbach&mdash;he to draw, and I to
saunter.... This most beautiful fall consists of a fine river,
which passes by successive steps down a very deep precipice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
into the lake. In some of these steps there is a clear
leap of water of 100 feet or more, in others most beautiful
combinations of leap, cataract, and rapid, the finest rocks
occurring at the sides and bed of the torrent. In one part
a bridge passes over it. In another a cavern and a path
occur under it. To-day every fall was foaming from the
abundance of water, and the current of wind brought down
by it was in some parts almost too strong to stand against.
The sun shone brightly, and the rainbows seen from various
points were very beautiful. One at the bottom of a fine but
furious fall was very pleasant. There it remained motionless,
whilst the gusts and clouds of spray swept furiously
across its place, and were dashed against the rock. It
looked like a spirit strong in faith and stedfast in the
midst of the storm of passions sweeping across it; and
though it might fade and revive, still it held on to the
rock as in hope and giving hope; and the very drops
which in the whirlwind of their fury seemed as if they
would carry all away, were made to revive it and give it
greater beauty.</p>

<p>"How often are the things we fear and esteem as troubles
made to become blessings to those who are led to receive
them with humility and patience."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In concluding this section it may be well to string together
a few gems from Faraday's lectures or correspondence,
though they are greatly damaged by being torn away from
their original setting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After all, though your science is much to me, we are
not friends for science sake only, but for something <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>better
in a man, something more important in his nature, affection,
kindness, good feeling, moral worth; and so, in remembrance
of these, I now write to place myself in your
presence, and in thought shake hands, tongues, and hearts
together." This was addressed to Schönbein.</p>

<p>"I should be glad to think that high mental powers
insured something like a high moral sense, but have often
been grieved to see the contrary: as also, on the other
hand, my spirit has been cheered by observing in some
lowly and uninstructed creature such a healthful and
honourable and dignified mind as made one in love with
human nature. When that which is good mentally and
morally meet in one being, that that being is more fitted
to work out and manifest the glory of God in the creation,
I fully admit."</p>

<p>"Let me, as an old man who ought by this time to have
profited by experience, say that when I was younger I
found I often misinterpreted the intentions of people, and
found they did not mean what at the time I supposed they
meant; and further, that as a general rule, it was better to
be a little dull of apprehension when phrases seemed to
imply pique, and quick in perception when, on the contrary,
they seemed to imply kindly feeling. The real truth
never fails ultimately to appear; and opposing parties, if
wrong, are sooner convinced when replied to forbearingly,
than when overwhelmed."</p>

<p>"Man is an improving animal. Unlike the animated
world around him, which remains in the same constant
state, he is continually varying; and it is one of the noblest
prerogatives of his nature, that in the highest of earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
distinctions he has the power of raising and exalting
himself continually. The transitory state of man has been
held up to him as a memento of his weakness: to man
<em>degraded</em> it may be so with justice; to man as he ought
to be it is no reproach; and in knowledge, that man only
is to be contemned and despised who is <em>not</em> in a state
of transition."</p>

<p>"It is not the duty or place of a philosopher to dictate
belief, and all hypothesis is more or less matter of
belief; he has but to give his facts and his conclusions,
and so much of the logic which connects the former with
the latter as he may think necessary, and then to commit
the whole to the scientific world for present, and, as he
may sometimes without presumption believe, for future
judgment."</p>

<h2 class="no-break">SECTION IV.<br />

<span class="medfont">HIS METHOD OF WORKING.</span></h2>

<p>It is on record that when a young aspirant asked Faraday
the secret of his success as a scientific investigator, he
replied, "The secret is comprised in three words&mdash;Work,
Finish, Publish."</p>

<p>Each of these words, we may be sure, is full of meaning,
and will guide us in a useful inquiry.</p>

<p>Already in the "Story of his Life" we have caught some
glimpses of the philosopher at work in his laboratory; but
before looking at him more closely let us learn from a
foreigner with what feelings to enter a place that is hallowed
by so many memories sacred in the history of science.
Professor Schönbein, of Basle, who visited England in
1840, says: "During my stay in London, I once worked
with Faraday for a whole day long in the laboratory of the
Royal Institution, and I cannot forbear to say that this was
one of the most enjoyable days that I ever spent in the
British capital. We commenced our day's work with breakfast;
and when that was over, I was supplied with one of
the laboratory dresses of my friend, which, when I was presented
in it to the ladies, gave occasion to no little amusement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
as the dimensions of Faraday are different from those
of my precious body.</p>

<p>"To work with a man like Faraday was in itself a great
pleasure; but this pleasure was not a little heightened in
doing so in a place where such grand secrets of nature had
been unfolded, the most brilliant discoveries of the century
had been made, and entirely new branches of knowledge
had been brought forth. For the empty intellect circumstances
of this nature are indeed of little special value; but
they stand in quite another relation to our power of imagination
and inner nature.</p>

<p>"I do not deny that my surroundings produced in me
a very peculiar feeling; and whilst I trod the floor upon
which Davy had once walked&mdash;whilst I availed myself of
some instrument which this great discoverer had himself
handled&mdash;whilst I stood working at the very table at which
the ever-memorable man sought to solve the most difficult
problems of science, at which Faraday enticed the first
sparks out of the magnet, and discovered the most beautiful
laws of the chemical action of current electricity,
I felt myself inwardly elevated, and believed that I myself
experienced something of the inbreathing of the scientific
spirit which formerly ruled there with such creative power,
and which still works on."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The habit of Faraday was to think out carefully beforehand
the subject on which he was working, and to plan
his mode of attack. Then, if he saw that some new piece
of apparatus was needed, he would describe it fully to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>the
instrument maker with a drawing, and it rarely happened
that there was any need of alteration in executing the order.
If, however, the means of experiment existed already, he
would give Anderson a written list of the things he would
require, at least a day before&mdash;for Anderson was not to be
hurried. When all was ready, he would descend into the
laboratory, give a quick glance round to see that all was
right, take his apron from the drawer, and rub his hands
together as he looked at the preparations made for his work.
There must be no tool on the table but such as he required.
As he began, his face would be exceedingly grave, and
during the progress of an experiment all must be perfectly
quiet; but if it was proceeding according to his wish, he
would commence to hum a tune, and sometimes to rock
himself sideways, balancing alternately on either foot.
Then, too, he would often talk to his assistant about the
result he was expecting. He would put away each tool in
its own place as soon as done with, or at any rate when
the day's work was over, and he would not unnecessarily
take a thing away from its place: thus, if he wanted a perforated
cork, he would go to the drawer which contained
the corks and cork-borers, make there what he wanted,
replace the borers, and shut the drawer. No bottle was
allowed to remain without its stopper; no open glass might
stand for a night without a paper cover; no rubbish was to
be left on the floor; bad smells were to be avoided if possible;
and machinery in motion was not permitted to grate.
In working, also, he was very careful not to employ more
force than was wanted to produce the effect. When his
experiments were finished and put away, he would leav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>e the
laboratory, and think further about them upstairs.</p>

<p>This orderliness and this economy of means he not only
practised himself, but he expected them also to be followed
by any who worked with him; and it is from conversation
with these that I have been enabled to give this sketch
of his manner of working.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>This exactness was also apparent in the accounts he
kept with the Royal Institution and Trinity House, in which
he entered every little item of expenditure with the greatest
minuteness of detail.</p>

<p>It was through this lifelong series of experiments that
Faraday won his knowledge and mastered the forces of
nature. The rare ingenuity of his mind was ably seconded
by his manipulative skill, while the quickness of his
perceptions was equalled by the calm rapidity of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
movements.</p>

<p>He had indeed a passion for experimenting. This peeps
out in the preface to the second edition of his "Chemical
Manipulation," where he writes, "Being intended especially
as a book of instruction, no attempts were made to render
it pleasing, otherwise than by rendering it effectual; for I
concluded that, if the work taught clearly what it was
intended to inculcate, the high interest always belonging to
a well-made or successful experiment would be abundantly
sufficient to give it all the requisite charms, and more than
enough to make it valuable in the eyes of those for whom
it was designed."</p>

<p>He could scarcely pass a gold leaf electrometer without
causing the leaves to diverge by a sudden flick from his silk
handkerchief. I recollect, too, his meeting me at the
entrance to the lecture theatre at Jermyn Street, when Lyon
Playfair was to give the first, or one of the first lectures ever
delivered in the building. "Let us go up here," said he,
leading me far away from the central table. I asked him
why he chose such an out-of-the-way place. "Oh," he
replied, "we shall be able here to find out what are the
acoustic qualities of the room."</p>

<p>The simplicity of the means with which he made his
experiments was often astonishing, and was indeed one of
the manifestations of his genius.</p>

<p>A good instance is thus narrated by Sir Frederick Arrow.
"When the electric light was first exhibited permanently at
Dungeness, on 6th June, 1862, a committee of the Elder
Brethren, of which I was one, accompanied Faraday to
observe it. We dined, I think, at Dover, and embarke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>d in
the yacht from there, and were out for some hours watching
it, to Faraday's great delight&mdash;(a very fine night)&mdash;and
especially we did so from the Varne lightship, about equidistant
between it and the French light of Grisnez, using
all our best glasses and photometers to ascertain the relative
value of the lights: and this brings me to my story.
Before we left Dover, Faraday, with his usual bright smile,
in great glee showed me a little common paper box, and
said, 'I must take care of this; it's my special photometer,'&mdash;and
then, opening it, produced a lady's ordinary
black shawl-pin,&mdash;jet, or imitation perhaps,&mdash;and then
holding it a little way off the candle, showed me the image
very distinct; and then, putting it a little further off, placed
another candle near it, and the relative distance was shown
by the size of the image. He lent me this afterwards when
we were at the Varne lightship, and it acted admirably;
and ever since I have used one as a very convenient mode
of observing, and I never do so but I think of that night
and dear good Faraday, and his genial happy way of
showing how even common things may be made useful."
After this Faraday modified his glass-bead photometer, and
he might be seen comparing the relative intensity of two
lights by watching their luminous images on a bead of
black glass, which he had threaded on a string, and was
twirling round so as to resolve the brilliant points into
circles of fainter light; or he fixed the black glass balls on
pieces of cork, and, attaching them to a little wheel, set
them spinning for the same purpose. Some of these beads
are preserved by the Trinity House, with other treasures of
a like kind, including a flat piece of solder of an irregul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>ar
oval form, turned up at one side so as to form a thumb-rest,
and which served the philosopher as a candlestick to support
the wax-light that he used as a standard. The museum of
the Royal Institution contains a most instructive collection
of his experimental apparatus, including the common electrical
machine which he made while still an apprentice at
Riebau's, and the ring of soft iron, with its twisted coils
of wire isolated by calico and tied with common string, by
means of which he first obtained electrical effects from a
magnet.</p>

<p>In lecturing to the young he delighted to show how easily
apparatus might be extemporized. Thus, in order to construct
an electrical machine he once inverted a four-legged
stool to serve for the stand, and took a white glass bottle for
the cylinder. A cork was fitted into the mouth of this bottle,
and a bung was fastened with sealing-wax to the other end:
into the cork was inserted a handle for rotating the bottle,
and in the centre of the bung was a wooden pivot on
which it turned; while with some stout wire he made
crutches on two of the legs of the stool for the axles of this
glass cylinder to work upon. The silk rubber he held in
his hand. A japanned tin tea-canister resting on a glass
tumbler formed the conductor, and the collector was the
head of a toasting fork. With this apparently rough
apparatus he exhibited all the rudimentary experiments in
electricity to a large audience.</p>

<p>Wishing to carry home in good condition a flower that
had been given him, he rolled a piece of writing-paper
round a cork, tied it tightly with string, and filled the little
tube with water. He had thus a perfectly efficient bouquet-holde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>r.</p>

<p>A lady, calling on his wife, happened to mention that a
needle had been once broken into her foot, and she did
not know whether it had been all extracted or not. "Oh!"
said Faraday, "I will soon tell you that,"&mdash;and taking a
finely suspended magnetic needle, he held it close to her
foot, and it dipped to the concealed iron.</p>

<p>On this subject Schönbein has also some good remarks.
"The laboratory of the Institution is indeed efficiently arranged,
though anything but large and elaborately furnished.
And yet something extraordinary has happened in this room
for the extension of the limits of knowledge; and already
more has been done in it than in many other institutions
where the greatest luxury in the supply of apparatus
prevails, and where there is the greatest command of
money. But when men work with the creative genius of
a Davy, and the intuitive spirit of investigation and the
wealth of ideas of a Faraday, important and great things
must come to pass, even though the appliances at command
should be of so limited a character. For the experimental
investigator of nature, it is especially desirable that, according
to the kind of his researches, he should have at command
such and such appliances, that he should possess a
'philosophical apparatus,' a laboratory, &amp;c.; but for the
purpose of producing something important, of greatly
widening the sphere of knowledge, it in no way follows that
a superfluity of such things is necessary to him.... He
who understands how to put appropriate questions to Nature,
generally knows how to extract the answers by simple
means; and he who wants this capacity will, I fear, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>obtain
no profitable result, even though all conceivable tools and
apparatus may be ready to his hand."</p>

<p>Nor did Faraday require elaborate apparatus to illustrate
his meaning. Steaming up the Thames one July day in a
penny boat, he was struck with the offensiveness of the
water. He tore some white cards into pieces, wetted them
so as to make them sink easily, and dropped them into the
river at each pier they came to. Their sudden disappearance
from sight, though the sun was shining brightly, was proof
enough of the impurity of the stream; and he wrote a letter
to the <cite>Times</cite> describing his observations, and calling public
attention to the dangerous state of the river.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> At a meeting
of the British Association he wished to explain the manner
in which certain crystallized bodies place themselves between
the poles of an electro-magnet: two or three raw potatoes
furnished the material out of which he cut admirable
models of the crystals. Wishing to show the electrical
nature of gun-cotton, he has been known to lay his watch
upon the table, balance on it a slender piece of wood,
and, charging a morsel of the gun-cotton by drawing it
along his coat sleeve, cause the wood to revolve towards
the electric fibres.</p>

<p>"An artist was once maintaining that in natural appearances
and in pictures, up and down, and high and low, were
fixed indubitable realities; but Faraday told him that they
were merely conventional acceptations, based on standards
often arbitrary. The disputant could not be convinced tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>t
ideas which he had hitherto never doubted had such shifting
foundations. 'Well,' said Faraday, 'hold a walking-stick
between your chin and your great toe; look along it and
say which is the upper end.' The experiment was tried,
and the artist found his idea of perspective at complete
variance with his sense of reality; either end of the stick
might be called 'upper,'&mdash;pictorially it was one, physically
it was the other."</p>

<p>Faraday's manner of experimenting may be further illustrated
by the recollections of other friends who have had
the opportunity of watching him at work.</p>

<p>Mr. James Young, who was in the laboratory of University
College in 1838, thus writes:&mdash;"About that time
Professor Graham had got from Paris Thilorier's apparatus
for producing liquid and solid carbonic acid; hearing of
this, Mr. Faraday came to Graham's laboratory, and, as
one might expect, showed great interest in this apparatus,
and asked Graham for the loan of it for a Friday evening
lecture at the Royal Institution, which of course Graham
readily granted, and Faraday asked me to come down to
the Institution and give him the benefit of my experience
in charging and working the apparatus; so I spent a long
evening at the Royal Institution laboratory. There was
no one present but Faraday, Anderson, and myself. The
principal thing we did was to charge the apparatus and
work with the solid carbonic acid, Mr. Faraday working
with great activity; his motions were wonderfully rapid;
and if he had to cross the laboratory for anything, he did
not walk at an ordinary step, but ran for it, and when he
wanted anything he spoke quickly. Faraday had a theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
at that time that all metals would become magnetic if their
temperature were low enough; and he tried that evening
some experiments with cobalt and manganese, which he
cooled in a mixture of carbonic acid and ether, but the
results were negative."</p>

<p>Among the deep mines of the Durham coal-field is one
called the Haswell Colliery. One Saturday afternoon, while
the men were at work in it as usual, a terrible explosion
occurred: it proceeded from the fire-damp that collects in
the vaulted space that is formed in old workings, when
the supporting pillars of coal are removed and the roof
falls in: the suffocating gases rushed along the narrow
passages, and overwhelmed ninety-five poor fellows with
destruction. Of course there was an inquiry, and the
Government sent down to the spot as their commissioners
Professor Faraday and Sir Charles Lyell. The two gentlemen
attended at the coroner's inquest, where they took
part in the examination of the witnesses; they inspected
the shattered safety-lamps; they descended into the mine,
spending the best part of a day in the damaged and therefore
dangerous galleries where the catastrophe had occurred,
and they did not leave without showing in a practical
form their sympathy with the sufferers. When down in the
pit, an inspector showed them the way in which the workmen
estimated the rapidity of the ventilation draught, by
throwing a pinch of gunpowder through the flame of a
candle, and timing the movement of the little puff of
smoke. Faraday, not admiring the free and easy way in
which they handled their powder, asked where they kept
their store of it, and learnt that it was in a large b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>lack
bag which had been assigned to him as the most comfortable
seat they could offer. We may imagine the liveliness
with which he sprang to his feet, and expostulated with
them on their culpable carelessness.</p>

<p>My own opportunities of observing Faraday at work were
nearly confined to a series of experiments, which are the
better worth describing here as they have escaped the
notice of previous biographers. The Royal Commission
appointed to inquire into our whole system of Lights,
Buoys, and Beacons, perceived a great defect that rendered
many of our finest shore or harbour lights comparatively
ineffective. The great central lamp in a lighthouse
is surrounded by a complicated arrangement of
lenses and prisms, with the object of gathering up as many
of the rays as possible and sending them over the surface
of the sea towards the horizon. Now, it is evident that
if this apparatus be adjusted so as to send the beam two
or three degrees upwards, the light will be lost to the shipping
and wasted on the clouds; and if two or three degrees
downwards, it will only illuminate the water in the neighbourhood:
in either case the beautiful and expensive
apparatus would be worse than useless. It is evident also
that if the eye be placed just above the wick of the lamp,
it will see through any particular piece of glass that very
portion of the landscape which will be illuminated by a
ray starting from the same spot; or the photographic image
formed in the place of the flame by any one of the lenses
will tell us the direction in which that lens will throw the
luminous rays. This simple principle was applied by the
Commissioners for testing the adjustment of the apparat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>us
in the different lights, and it was found that few were rightly
placed, or rather that no method of adjustment was in use
better than the mason's plumbline. The Royal Commissioners
therefore in 1860 drew the attention of all the lighthouse
authorities to this fact, and asked the Elder Brethren of
the Trinity House, with Faraday and other parties, to meet
them at the lights recently erected at the North Foreland
and Whitby. I, as the scientific member of the Commission,
had drawn out in detail the course of rays from different
parts of the flame, through different parts of the
apparatus, and I was struck with the readiness with which
Faraday, who had never before considered the matter,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> took
up the idea, and recognized its importance and its practical
application. With his characteristic ingenuity, too, he devised
a little piece of apparatus for the more exact observation of
the matter inside the lighthouse. He took to Mr. Ladd, the
optical instrument maker, a drawing, very neatly executed,
with written directions, and a cork cut into proper shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with two lucifer matches stuck through it, to serve as a further
explanation of his meaning: and from this the "focimeter,"
as he called it, was made. The position of the glass panels
at Whitby was corrected by means of this little instrument,
and there were many journeys down to Chance's glassworks
near Birmingham, where, declining the hospitality of the
proprietor in order to be absolutely independent, he put up
at a small hotel while he made his experiments, and jotted
down his observations on the cards he habitually carried
in his pocket. At length we were invited down to see the
result. Faraday explained carefully all that had been done,
and at the risk of sea-sickness (no trifling matter in his case)
accompanied us out to sea to observe the effect from various
directions and at various distances. The experience acquired
at Whitby was applied elsewhere, and in May 1861 the
Trinity House appointed a Visiting Committee, "to examine
all dioptric light establishments, with the view of remedying
any inaccuracies of arrangement that may be found to exist."
Faraday had instructed and practised Captain Nisbet and
some others of the Elder Brethren in the use of the focimeter,
and now wrote a careful letter of suggestions on the
question of adjustment between the lamp and the lenses
and prisms; so thoughtfully did he work for the benefit of
those who "go down to the sea in ships, that do business
in great waters."</p>

<p>As to the mental process that devised, directed, and
interpreted his experiments, it must be borne in mind that
Faraday was no mathematician; his power of appreciating
an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> reason often appeared comparatively weak. "It
has been stated on good authority that Faraday boasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
on a certain occasion of having only once in the course
of his life performed a mathematical calculation: that once
was when he turned the handle of Babbage's calculating
machine."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Though there was more pleasantry than truth
in this professed innocence of numbers, probably no one
acquainted with his electrical researches will doubt that,
had he possessed more mathematical ability, he would have
been saved much trouble, and would sometimes have expressed
his conclusions with greater ease and precision.
Yet, as Sir William Thomson has remarked with reference
to certain magnetic phenomena, "Faraday, without mathematics,
divined the result of the mathematical investigation;
and, what has proved of infinite value to the mathematicians
themselves, he has given them an articulate language
in which to express their results. Indeed, the whole language
of the magnetic field and 'lines of force' is Faraday's.
It must be said for the mathematicians that they
greedily accepted it, and have ever since been most zealous
in using it to the best advantage."</p>

<p>The peculiarity of his mind was indeed well known
to himself. In a letter to Dr. Becker he says: "I was
never able to make a fact my own without seeing it; and
the descriptions of the best works altogether failed to
convey to my mind such a knowledge of things as to
allow myself to form a judgment upon them. It was so
with <em>new</em> things. If Grove, or Wheatstone, or Gassiot, or
any other told me a new fact, and wanted my opinion
either of its value, or the cause, or the evidence it could
give on any subject, I never could say anything until I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had seen the fact. For the same reason I never could
work, as some Professors do most extensively, by students
or pupils. All the work had to be my own."</p>

<p>Thus we are told what took place "when Dr. Tyndall
brought Mr. Faraday into the laboratory to look at his new
discovery of calorescence. As Faraday saw for the first
time a piece of cold, black platinum raised to a dazzling
brightness when held in the focus of dark rays, a point
undistinguishable from the air around, he looked on attentively,
putting on his spectacles to observe more carefully,
then ascertained the conditions of the experiment, and
repeated it for himself; and now quite satisfied, he turned
with emotion to Dr. Tyndall, and almost hugged him with
pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The following story by Mr. Robert Mallet also serves as
an illustration:&mdash;"It must be now eighteen years ago when
I paid him a visit and brought some slips of flexible and
<em>tough</em> Muntz's yellow metal, to show him the instantaneous
change to complete brittleness with rigidity produced by
dipping into pernitrate of mercury solution. He got the
solution, and I <em>showed</em> him the facts; he obviously did not
doubt what he saw <em>me</em> do before and close to him: but a
sort of experimental instinct seemed to require he should try
it himself. So he took one of the slips, bent it forwards
and backwards, dipped it, and broke it up into short bits
between his own fingers. He had not before spoken. <em>Then</em>
he said, 'Yes, it <em>is</em> pliable, and it <em>does</em> become instantly
brittle.' And after a few moments' pause he added, 'Well,
now have you any more facts of the sort?' and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a little disappointed when I said, 'No; none that are new.'
It has often since occurred to me how his mind needed
absolute satisfaction that he had grasped a <em>fact</em>, and then
instantly rushed to colligate it with another if possible."</p>

<p>But as the Professor watched these new facts, new
thoughts would shape themselves in his mind, and this
would lead to fresh experiments in order to test their truth.
The answers so obtained would lead to further questions.
Thus his work often consisted in the defeat of one hypothesis
after another, till the true conditions of the phenomena
came forth and claimed the assent of the experimenter and
ultimately of the scientific world.</p>

<p>A. de la Rive has some acute observations on this
subject. He explains how Faraday did not place himself
before his apparatus, setting it to work, without a preconceived
idea. Neither did he take up known phenomena,
as some scientific men do, and determine their numerical
data, or study with great precision the laws which regulate
them. "A third method, very different from the preceding,
is that which, quitting the beaten track, leads, as if by
inspiration, to those great discoveries which open new
horizons to science. This method, in order to be fertile,
requires one condition&mdash;a condition, it is true, which is
but rarely met with&mdash;namely, genius. Now, this condition
existed in Faraday. Endowed, as he himself perceived,
with much imagination, he dared to advance where many
others would have recoiled: his sagacity, joined to an
exquisite scientific tact, by furnishing him with a presentiment
of the possible, prevented him from wandering into
the fantastic; while, always wishing only for fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>s, and
accepting theories only with difficulty, he was nevertheless
more or less directed by preconceived ideas, which,
whether true or false, led him into new roads, where most
frequently he found what he sought, and sometimes also
what he did not seek, but where he constantly met with
some important discovery.</p>

<p>"Such a method, if indeed it can be called one, although
barren and even dangerous with mediocre minds, produced
great things in Faraday's hands; thanks, as we have said, to
his genius, but thanks also to that love of truth which characterized
him, and which preserved him from the temptation
so often experienced by every discoverer, of seeing what he
wishes to see, and not seeing what he dreads."</p>

<p>This love of truth deserves a moment's pause. It was
one of the most beautiful and most essential of his characteristics;
it taught him to be extremely cautious in receiving
the statements of others or in drawing his own conclusions,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and it led him, if his scepticism was overcome, to adopt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
once the new view, and to maintain it, if need be, against
the world.</p>

<p>"The thing I am proudest of, Pearsall, is that I have
never been found to be wrong," he could say in the early
part of his scientific history without fear of contradiction.
After his death A. de la Rive wrote, "I do not think that
Faraday has once been caught in a mistake; so precise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
conscientious was his mode of experimenting and observing."
This is not absolutely true; but the extreme rarity
of his mistakes, notwithstanding the immense amount of
his published researches, is one of those marvels which
can be appreciated only by those who are in the habit of
describing what they have seen in the mist land that lies
beyond the boundaries of previous knowledge.</p>

<p>Into this unknown region his mental vision was ever
stretched. "I well remember one day," writes Mr. Barrett,
a former assistant at the Royal Institution, "when Mr.
Faraday was by my side, I happened to be steadying, by
means of a magnet, the motion of a magnetic needle
under a glass shade. Mr. Faraday suddenly looked most
impressively and earnestly as he said, 'How wonderful and
mysterious is that power you have there! the more I think
over it the less I seem to know:'&mdash;and yet he who said this
knew more of it than any living man."</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine with what wonder he would stand
before the apples or leaves or pieces of meat that swung
round into a transverse position between the poles of his
gigantic magnet, or the sand that danced and eddied into
regular figures on plates of glass touched by the fiddle-bow,
or gold so finely divided that it appeared purple and when
diffused in water took a twelvemonth to settle. It is easy,
too, to imagine how he would long to gain a clear idea
of what was taking place behind the phenomena. But it
is far from easy to grasp the conceptions of his brain:
language is a clumsy vehicle for such thoughts. He strove
to get rid of such figurative terms as "currents" and
"poles;" in discussing the mode of propagation of light
and radiant heat he endeavoured "to dismiss the ether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
but not the vibrations;" and in conceiving of atoms, he
says: "As to the little solid particles ... I cannot form
any idea of them apart from the forces, so I neither admit
nor deny them. They do not afford me the least help in
my endeavour to form an idea of a particle of matter. On
the contrary, they greatly embarrass me." Yet he could not
himself escape from the tyranny of words or the deceitfulness
of metaphors, and it is hard for his readers to comprehend
what was his precise idea of those centres of forces
that occupy no space, or of those lines of force which he
beheld with his mental eye, curving alike round his magnetic
needle, and that mightiest of all magnets&mdash;the earth.</p>

<p>As he was jealous of his own fame, and had learnt by
experience that discoveries could be stolen, he talked little
about them till they were ready for the public; indeed, he
has been known to twit a brother electrician for telling his
discoveries before printing them, adding with a knowing
laugh, "I never do that." He was obliged, however, to
explain his results to Professor Whewell, or some other
learned friend, if he wished to christen some new idea with
a Greek name. One of Whewell's letters on such an occasion,
dated Trinity College, Cambridge, October 14, 1837,
begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I am always glad to hear of the progress of your
researches, and never the less so because they require the
fabrication of a new word or two. Such a coinage has
always taken place at the great epochs of discovery; like
the medals that are struck at the beginning of a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reign, or rather like the change of currency produced by
the accession of a new Sovereign; for their value and influence
consists in their coming into common circulation."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the whole time of an investigation Faraday had
kept ample notes, and when all was completed he had little
to do but to copy these notes, condensing or re-arranging
some parts, and omitting what was useless. The paper
then usually consisted of a series of numbered paragraphs,
containing first a statement of the subject of inquiry, then a
series of experiments giving negative results, and afterwards
the positive discoveries. In this form it was sent to the
Royal Society or some other learned body. Yet this often
involved considerable labour, as the following words written
to Miss Moore in 1850 from a summer retreat in Upper
Norwood will show:&mdash;"I write and write and write, until
nearly three papers for the Royal Society are nearly completed,
and I hope that two of them will be good if they
do justify my hopes, for I have to criticise them again and
again before I let them loose. You shall hear of them at
some of the next Friday evenings."</p>

<p>This criticism did not cease with their publication, for
he endeavoured always to improve on his previous work.
Thus, in 1832 he bound his papers together in one volume,
and the introduction on the fly-leaf shows the object with
which it was done:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Papers of mine, published in octavo, in the <cite>Quarterly
Journal of Science</cite>, and elsewhere, since the time that Sir H.
Davy encouraged me to write the analysis of caustic lime.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>"Some, I think (at this date), are good, others moderate,
and some bad. But I have put <em>all</em> into the volume, because
of the utility they have been of to me&mdash;and none more than
the bad&mdash;in pointing out to me in future, or rather after
times, the faults it became me to watch and to avoid.</p>

<p>"As I never looked over one of my papers a year after
it was written, without believing, both in philosophy and
manner, it could have been much better done, I still hope
the collection may be of great use to me.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>.</p>

<p class="leftalignindent1">"<em>August 18, 1832</em>."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This section may be summed up in the words of Dumas
when he gave the first "Faraday Lecture" of the Chemical
Society:&mdash;"Faraday is the type of the most fortunate and
the most accomplished of the learned men of our age. His
hand in the execution of his conceptions kept pace with his
mind in designing them; he never wanted boldness when
he undertook an experiment, never lacked resources to
ensure success, and was full of discretion in interpreting
results. His hardihood, which never halted when once he
had undertaken a task, and his wariness, which felt its way
carefully in adopting a received conclusion, will ever serve
as models for the experimentalist."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="no-break">SECTION V.<br />

<span class="medfont">THE VALUE OF HIS DISCOVERIES.</span></h2>

<p>Science is pursued by different men from different motives.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"To some she is the goddess great;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To some the milch-cow of the field;</div>
<div class="verse indentbase">Their business is to calculate</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The butter she will yield."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now, Faraday had been warned by Davy before he entered
his service that Science was a mistress who paid badly; and
in 1833 we have seen him deliberately make his calculation,
give up the butter, and worship the goddess.</p>

<p>For the same reason also he declined most of the positions
of honour which he was invited to fill, believing that they
would encroach too much on his time, though he willingly
accepted the honorary degrees and scientific distinctions
that were showered upon him.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>And among those who follow Science lovingly, there are
two very distinct bands: there are the philosophers, the
discoverers, men who persistently ask questions of Nature;
and there are the practical men, who apply her answers to
the various purposes of human life. Many noble names are
inscribed in either bead-roll, but few are able to take rank
in both services: indeed, the question of practical utility
would terribly cramp the investigator, while the enjoyment
of patient research in unexplored regions of knowledge is
usually too ethereal for those who seek their pleasures in
useful inventions. The mental configuration is different in
the two cases; each may claim and receive his due award
of honour.</p>

<p>Faraday was pre-eminently a discoverer; he liked the
name of "philosopher." His favourite paths of study seem
to wander far enough from the common abodes of human
thought or the requirements of ordinary life. He became
familiar, as no other man ever was, with the varied forces of
magnetism and electricity, heat and light, gravitation and
galvanism, chemical affinity and mechanical motion; but he
did not seek to "harness the lightnings," or to chain those
giants and to make them grind like Samson in the prison-house.
His way of treating them reminds us rather of the old
fable of Proteus, who would transform himself into a whirlwind
or a dragon, a flame of fire or a rushing stream, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
order to elude his pursuer; but if the wary inquirer could
catch him asleep in his cave, he might be constrained to
utter all his secret knowledge: for the favourite thought of
Faraday seems to have been that these various forces were
the changing forms of a Proteus, and his great desire seems
to have been to learn the secret of their origin and their
transformations. Thus he loved to break down the walls of
separation between different classes of phenomena, and his
eye doubtless sparkled with delight when he saw what had
always been looked upon as permanent gases liquefy like
common vapours under the constraint of pressure and cold&mdash;when
the wires that coiled round his magnets gave signs
of an electric wave, or coruscated with sparks&mdash;when the
electricities derived from the friction machine and from the
voltaic pile yielded him the same series of phenomena&mdash;when
he recognized the cumulative proof that the quantity
of electricity in a galvanic battery is exactly proportional to
the chemical action&mdash;when his electro-static theory seemed
to break down the barrier between the conductors and insulators,
and many other barriers beside&mdash;when he sent a ray of
polarized light through a piece of heavy glass between the
poles of an electro-magnet, and on making contact saw that
the plane of polarization was rotated, or, as he said, the light
was magnetized&mdash;and when he watched pieces of bismuth,
or crystals of Iceland spar, or bubbles of oxygen, ranging
themselves in a definite position in the magnetic field.</p>

<p>"I delight in hearing of exact numbers, and the determinations
of the equivalents of force when different forms of
force are compared one with another," he wrote to Joule
in 1845; and no wonder, for these quantitative comparis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>ons
have proved many of his speculations to be true, and have
made them the creed of the scientific world. When he
began to investigate the different sciences, they might be
compared to so many different countries with impassable
frontiers, different languages and laws, and various weights
and measures; but when he ceased they resembled rather a
brotherhood of states, linked together by a community of
interests and of speech, and a federal code; and in bringing
about this unification no one had so great a share as
himself.</p>

<p>He loved to speculate, too, on Matter and Force, on the
nature of atoms and of imponderable agents. "It is these
things," says the great German physicist Professor Helmholz,
"that Faraday, in his mature works, ever seeks to purify
more and more from everything that is theoretical, and is
not the direct and simple expression of the fact. For
instance, he contended against the action of forces at a
distance, and the adoption of two electrical and two magnetic
fluids, as well as all hypotheses contrary to the law of
the conservation of force, which he early foresaw, though he
misunderstood it in its scientific expression. And it is just
in this direction that he exercised the most unmistakeable
influence first of all on the English physicists."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>While, however, Faraday was pre-eminently an experimental
philosopher, he was far from being indifferent to the
useful applications of science. His own connection with the
practical side of the question was threefold: he undertook
some laborious investigations of this nature himself; he was
frequently called upon, especially by the Trinity House, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
give his opinions on the inventions of others; and he was
fond of bringing useful inventions before the members of
the Royal Institution in his Friday evening discourses. The
first of these, on February 3, 1826, was on India-rubber,
and was illustrated by an abundance of specimens both in
the raw and manufactured states. He traced the history of
the substance, from the crude uncoagulated sap to the sheet
rubber and waterproof fabrics which Mr. Hancock and Mr.
Macintosh had recently succeeded in preparing. In this
way also he continued to throw the magic of his genius around
Morden's machinery for manufacturing Bramah's locks,
Ericsson's caloric engine, Brunel's block machinery at Portsmouth,
Petitjean's process for silvering mirrors, the prevention
of dry-rot in timber, De la Rue's envelope machinery,
artificial rubies, Bonelli's electric silk loom, Barry's mode of
ventilating the House of Lords, and many kindred subjects.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to describe the last of his Friday
evenings, in which he brought before the public Mr. C. W.
Siemens' Regenerative Gas Furnace. The following letter
to the inventor will tell the first steps:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>, <em>March 22, 1862</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have just returned from Birmingham&mdash;and there
saw at Chance's works the application of your furnaces
to glass-making. I was very much struck with the whole
matter.</p>

<p>"As our managers want me to end the F. evenings
here after Easter, I have looked about for a thought, for I
have none in myself. I think I should like to speak of the
effects I saw at Chance's, if you do not object. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
assent, can you help me with any drawings or models, or
illustrations either in the way of thoughts or experiments?
Do not say much about it out of doors as yet, for my mind
is not settled in what way (if you assent) I shall present the
subject.</p>

<p class="rightalignindent4">"Ever truly yours,</p>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">C. W. Siemens, Esq.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course the permission was gladly given, and Mr.
Siemens met him at Birmingham, and for two days conducted
him about works for flint and crown glass, or for
enamel, as well as about ironworks, in which his principle
was adopted, wondering at the Professor's simplicity of
character as well as at his ready power of grasping the
whole idea. Then came the Friday evening, 20th June,
1862, in which he explained the great saving of heat
effected, and pictured the world of flame into which he had
gazed in some of those furnaces. But his powers of lecturing
were enfeebled, and during the course of the hour he
burnt his notes by accident, and at the conclusion he very
pathetically bade his audience farewell, telling them that he
felt he had been before them too long, and that the experience
of that evening showed he was now useless as their
public servant, but he would still endeavour to do what he
could privately for the Institution. The usual abstract of
the lecture appeared, but not from his unaided pen.</p>

<p>Inventors, and promoters of useful inventions, frequently
benefited by the advice of Faraday, or by his generous help.
A remarkable instance of this was told me by Cyrus Field.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Near the commencement of his great enterprise, when he
wished to unite the old and the new worlds by the
telegraphic cable, he sought the advice of the great electrician,
and Faraday told him that he doubted the possibility
of getting a message across the Atlantic. Mr. Field saw that
this fatal objection must be settled at once, and begged
Faraday to make the necessary experiments, offering to pay
him properly for his services. The philosopher, however,
declined all remuneration, but worked away at the question,
and presently reported to Mr. Field:&mdash;"It can be done, but
you will not get an instantaneous message." "How long
will it take?" was the next inquiry. "Oh, perhaps a
second." "Well, that's quick enough for me," was the
conclusion of the American; and the enterprise was proceeded
with.</p>

<p>As to the electric telegraph itself, Faraday does not
appear among those who claim its parentage, but he was
constantly associated with those who do; his criticisms led
Ritchie to develop more fully his early conception, and he
was constantly engaged with batteries and wires and
magnets, while the telegraph was being perfected by others,
and especially by his friend Wheatstone, whose name will
always be associated with what is perhaps the most wonderful
invention of modern times.</p>

<p>As to Faraday's own work in applied science, his attempts
to improve the manufacture of steel, and afterwards of glass
for optical purposes, were among the least satisfactory of his
researches. He was more successful in the matter of ventilation
of lamp-burners. The windows of lighthouses were
frequently found streaming with water that arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> from the
combustion of the oil, and in winter this was often converted
into thick ice. He devised a plan by which this water was
effectually carried away, and the room was also made more
healthy for the keepers. At the Athenæum Club serious
complaints were made that the brilliantly lighted drawing-room
became excessively hot, and that headaches were very
common, while the bindings of the books were greatly
injured by the sulphuric acid that arose from the burnt
coal-gas. Faraday cured this by an arrangement of glass
cylinders over the ordinary lamp chimneys, and descending
tubes which carried off the whole products of combustion
without their ever mixing with the air of the room.
This principle could of course be applied to brackets or
chandeliers elsewhere, but the Professor made over any
pecuniary benefit that might accrue from it to his brother, who
was a lamp manufacturer, and had aided him in the invention.</p>

<p>The achievements of Faraday are certainly not to be
tested by a money standard, nor by their immediate adaptation
to the necessities or conveniences of life. "Practical
men" might be disposed to think slightly of the grand discoveries
of the philosopher. Their ideas of "utility" will
probably be different. One man may take his wheat corn
and convert it into loaves of bread, while his neighbour
appears to lose his labour by throwing the precious grain
into the earth: but which is after all most productive? The
loaves will at once feed the hungry, but the sower's toil will
be crowned in process of time by waving harvests.</p>

<p>Yet some of Faraday's most recondite inquiries did bear
practical fruit even during his own lifetime. In proof of
this I will take one of his chemical and two of his elect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>rical
discoveries.</p>

<p>Long ago there was a Portable Gas Company, which
made oil-gas and condensed it into a liquid. This liquid
Faraday examined in 1824, and he found the most important
constituent of it to be a light volatile oil, which he
called bicarburet of hydrogen. The gas company, I presume,
came to an end; but what of the volatile liquid?
Obtained from coal-tar, and renamed Benzine or Benzol,
it is now prepared on a large scale, and used as a solvent
in some of our industrial arts. But other chemists have
worked upon it, and torturing it with nitric acid, they have
produced nitrobenzol&mdash;a gift to the confectioner and the
perfumer. And by attacking this with reducing agents there
was called into existence the wondrous base aniline,&mdash;wondrous
indeed when we consider the transformations it
underwent in the hands of Hofmann, and the light it was
made to throw on the internal structure of organic compounds.
Faraday used sometimes to pay a visit to the
Royal College of Chemistry, and revel in watching these
marvellous reactions. But aniline was of use to others
besides the theoretical chemist. Tortured by fresh appliances,
this base gave highly-coloured bodies which it was
found possible to fix on cotton as well as woollen and silken
fabrics, and thence sprang up a large and novel branch of
industry, while our eyes were delighted with the rich hues
of mauve and magenta, the Bleu de Paris, and various other
"aniline dyes."</p>

<p>Everyone who is at all acquainted with the habits of
electricity knows that the most impassable of obstacles is
the air, while iron bolts and bars only help it in its fli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>ght:
yet, if an electrified body be brought near another body,
with this invisible barrier between them, the electrical state
of the second body is disturbed. Faraday thought much
over this question of "induction," as it is called, and found
himself greatly puzzled to comprehend how a body should act
where it is not. At length he satisfied himself by experiment
that the interposed obstacle is itself affected by the
electricity, and acquires an electro-polar state by which it
modifies electric action in its neighbourhood. The amount
varies with the nature of the substance, and Faraday estimated
it for such dielectrics as sulphur, shellac, or spermaceti,
compared with air. He termed this new property of matter
"specific inductive capacity," and figured in his own mind
the play of the molecules as they propagated and for a while
retained the force. Now, these very recondite observations
were opposed to the philosophy of the day, and they were
not received by some of the leading electricians, especially
of the Continent, while those who first tried to extend his
experiments blundered over the matter. However, the present
Professor Sir William Thomson, then a student at Cambridge,
showed that while Faraday's views were rigorously
deducible from Coulomb's theory, this discovery was a
great advance in the philosophy of the subject. When
submarine telegraph wires had to be manufactured, Thomson
took "specific inductive capacity" into account in determining
the dimensions of the cable: for we have there all
the necessary conditions&mdash;the copper wire is charged with
electricity, the covering of gutta-percha is a "dielectric," and
the water outside is ready to have an opposite electric condition
induced in it. The result is that, as Faraday himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
predicted, the message is somewhat retarded; and of course
it becomes a thing of importance so to arrange matters that
this retardation may be as small as possible, and the signals
may follow one another speedily. Now this must depend
not only on the thickness of the covering, but also on the
nature of the substance employed, and it was likely enough
that gutta-percha was not the best possible substance. In
fact, when Professor Fleeming Jenkin came to try the
inductive capacity of gutta-percha by means of the Red Sea
cable, he found it to be almost double that of shellac, which
was the highest that Faraday had determined, and attempts
have been made since to obtain some substance which should
have less of this objectionable quality and be as well
adapted otherwise for coating a wire. There is Hooper's
material, the great merit of which is its low specific inductive
capacity, so that it permits of the sending of four
signals while gutta-percha will only allow three to pass
along; and Mr. Willoughby Smith has made an improved
kind of gutta-percha with reduced capacity. Of course no
opinion is expressed here on the value of these inventions,
as many other circumstances must be taken into account,
such as their durability and their power of insulation,&mdash;that
is, preventing the leakage of the galvanic charge; but at
least they show that one of the most abstruse discoveries of
Faraday has penetrated already into our patent offices and
manufactories. Two students in the Physical Laboratory
at Glasgow have lately determined with great care the
inductive capacity of paraffin, and there can be little doubt
that the speculations of the philosopher as to the condition
of a dielectric will result in rendering it still more easy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>than
at present to send words of information or of friendly greeting
to our cousins across the Atlantic or the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The history of the magneto-electric light affords another
remarkable instance of the way in which one of Faraday's
most recondite discoveries bore fruit in his own lifetime;
and it is the more interesting as it fell to his own lot to
assist in bringing the fruit to maturity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">Brighton</span>, <em>November 29, 1831</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Phillips</span>,</p>

<p>"For once in my life I am able to sit down and
write to you without feeling that my time is so little that
my letter must of necessity be a short one; and accordingly
I have taken an extra large sheet of paper, intending
to fill it with news.</p>

<p>"But how are you getting on? Are you comfortable?
And how does Mrs. Phillips do; and the girls? Bad correspondent
as I am, I think you owe me a letter; and as
in the course of half an hour you will be doubly in my
debt, pray write us, and let us know all about you. Mrs.
Faraday wishes me not to forget to put her kind remembrances
to you and Mrs. Phillips in my letter....</p>

<p>"We are here to refresh. I have been working and
writing a paper that always knocks me up in health; but
now I feel well again, and able to pursue my subject; and
now I will tell you what it is about. The title will be, I
think, 'Experimental Researches in Electricity:'&mdash;I. On
the Induction of Electric Currents; II. On the Evolution
of Electricity from Magnetism; III. On a new Electrical
Condition of Matter; IV. On Arago's Magnetic Phenomena.
There is a bill of fare for you; and, what is more, I h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>ope
it will not disappoint you. Now, the pith of all this I
must give you very briefly; the demonstrations you shall
have in the paper when printed...."</p></blockquote>

<p>So wrote Faraday to his intimate friend Richard Phillips,
on November 29th, 1831, and the letter goes on to describe
the great harvest of results which he had gathered since
the 29th of August, when he first obtained evidence of an
electric current from a magnet. A few days afterwards he
was at work again on these curious relations of magnetism
and electricity in his laboratory, and at the Round Pond
in Kensington Gardens, and with Father Thames at
Waterloo Bridge. On the 8th of February he entered in
his note-book: "This evening, at Woolwich, experimented
with magnet, and for the first time got the magnetic spark
myself. Connected ends of a helix into two general ends,
and then crossed the wires in such a way that a blow at <em>a b</em>
would open them a little. Then bringing <em>a b</em> against the
poles of a magnet, the ends were disjoined, and bright
sparks resulted."</p>

<p>Next day he repeated this experiment at home with Mr.
Daniell's magnet, and then invited some of his best friends
to come and see the tiny speck of light.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>But what was the use of this little spark between the
shaken wires? "What is the use of an infant?" asked
Franklin once, when some such question was proposed
to him. Faraday said that the experimentalist's answer
was, "Endeavour to make it useful." But he passed to
other researches in the same field.</p>

<p>"I have rather been desirous," he says, "of discovering
new facts and new relations dependent on magneto-electric
induction, than of exalting the force of those already obtained;
being assured that the latter would find their full
development hereafter." And in this assurance he was not
mistaken. Electro-magnetism has been taken advantage of
on a large scale by the metallurgist and the telegrapher;
and even the photographer and sugar-refiner have attempted
to make it their servant; but it is its application as a source
of light that is most interesting to us in connection with
its discoverer.</p>

<p>Many "electric lights" were invented by "practical men,"
the power being generally derived from a galvanic battery;
and it was discovered that by making the terminals of the
wires of charcoal, the brilliancy of the spark could be
enormously increased. Some of these inventions were
proposed for lighthouses, and so came officially under the
notice of Faraday as scientific adviser to the Trinity House.
Thus he was engaged in 1853 and 1854 with the beautiful
electric light of Dr. Watson, which he examined most carefully,
evidently hoping it might be of service, and at length
he wrote an elaborate report pointing out its advantages,
but at the same time the difficulties in the way of its
practical adoption. The Trinity Corporation passed a special
vote of thanks for his report, and hesitated to proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
further in the matter.</p>

<p>But Faraday's own spark was destined to be more successful.
In 1853 some large magneto-electric machines
were set up in Paris for producing combustible gas by the
decomposition of water. The scheme failed, but a Mr.
F. H. Holmes suggested that these expensive toys might
be turned to account for the production of light. "My
propositions," he told the Royal Commissioners of Lighthouses,
"were entirely ridiculed, and the consequence was,
that instead of saying that I thought I could do it, I promised
to do it by a certain day. On that day, with one
of Duboscq's regulators or lamps, I produced the magneto-electric
light for the first time; but as the machines were
ill-constructed for the purpose, and as I had considerable
difficulty to make even a temporary adjustment to produce
a fitting current, the light could only be exhibited for a few
minutes at a time." He turned his attention to the reconstruction
of the machines, and after carrying on his experiments
in Belgium, he applied to the Trinity Board in
February 1857. Here was the tiny spark, which Faraday
had produced just twenty-five years before, exalted into a
magnificent star, and for Faraday it was reserved to decide
whether this star should shed its brilliance from the cliffs
of Albion. A good piece of optical apparatus, intended for
the Bishop Rock in the Scillies, happened to be at the experimental
station at Blackwall, and with this comparative
experiments were made. We can imagine something of the
interest with which Faraday watched the light from Woolwich,
and asked questions of the inventor about all the
details of its working and expense; and we can pi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>cture the
alternations of hope and caution as he wrote in his report,
"The light is so intense, so abundant, so concentrated and
focal, so free from under-shadows (caused in the common
lamp by the burner), so free from flickering, that one cannot
but desire it should succeed. But," he adds, "it would
require <em>very careful</em> and progressive introduction&mdash;men with
peculiar knowledge and skill to attend it; and the means of
instantly substituting one lamp for another in case of accident.
The common lamp is so simple, both in principle
and practice, that its liability to failure is very small. There
is no doubt that the magneto-electric lamp involves a great
number of circumstances tending to make its application
more refined and delicate; but I would fain hope that none
of these will prove a barrier to its introduction. Nevertheless,
it must pass into practice only through the ordeal of a
full, searching, and prolonged trial." This trial was made
in the upper of the two light towers at the South Foreland;
but it was not till the 8th December, 1858, that the experiment
was commenced. Faraday made observations on it
for the first two days, but it did not act well, and was discontinued
till March 28, 1859, when it again shot forth its
powerful rays across the Channel.</p>

<p>It was soon inspected by Faraday inside and outside, by
land and by sea. His notes terminate in this way:&mdash;"Went
to the hills round, about a mile off, or perhaps more, so as
to see both upper and lower light at once. The effect was
very fine. The lower light does not come near the upper
in its power, and, as to colour, looks red whilst the upper
is white. The visible rays proceed from both horizontally,
but those from the low light are not half so long as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
from the electric light. The radiation from the upper light
was beautifully horizontal, going out right and left with
intenseness like a horizontal flood of light, with blackness
above and blackness below, yet the sky was clear and the
stars shining brightly. It seemed as if the lanthorn<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> only
were above the earth, so dark was the path immediately
below the lanthorn, yet the whole tower was visible from
the place. As to the shadows of the uprights, one could
walk into one and across, and see the diminution of the
light, and could easily see when the edge of the shadow was
passed. They varied in width according to the distance
from the lanthorn. With upright bars their effect is considerable
at a distance, as seen last night; but inclining
these bars would help in the distance, though not so much
as with a light having considerable upright dimension, as is
the case with an oil-lamp.</p>

<p>"The shadows on a white card are very clear on the
edge&mdash;a watch very distinct and legible. On lowering the
head near certain valleys, the feeble shadow of the distant
grass and leaves was evident. The light was beautifully
steady and bright, with no signs of variation&mdash;the appearance
was such as to give confidence to the mind&mdash;no doubt
about its continuance.</p>

<p>"As a light it is unexceptionable&mdash;as a magneto-electric
light wonderful&mdash;and seems to have all the adjustments of
quality and more than can be applied to a voltaic electric
light or a Ruhmkorff coil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The Royal Commissioners and others saw with gratification
this beautiful light, and arrangements were made for
getting systematic observations of it by the keepers of all
the lighthouses within view, the masters of the light-vessels
that guard the Goodwin Sands, and the crews of pilot
cutters; after which Faraday wrote a very favourable report,
saying, among other things: "I beg to state that in my
opinion Professor Holmes has practically established the
fitness and sufficiency of the magneto-electric light for lighthouse
purposes, so far as its nature and management are
concerned. The light produced is powerful beyond any
other that I have yet seen so applied, and in principle may
be accumulated to any degree; its regularity in the lanthorn
is great, its management easy, and its care there may be
confided to attentive keepers of the ordinary degree of
intellect and knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The Elder Brethren then wished a further trial of six
months, during which time the light was to be entirely
under their own control. It was therefore again kindled
on August 22, and the experiment happened soon to be exposed
to a severe test, as one of the light-keepers, who had
been accustomed to the arrangement of the lamps in the
lantern, was suddenly removed, and another took his place
without any previous instruction. This man thought the
light sufficiently strong if he allowed the carbon points to
touch, as the lamp then required no attendance whatever,
and he could leave it in that way for hours together. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
being remonstrated with, he said, "It is quite good enough."
Notwithstanding such difficulties as these, the experiment
was considered satisfactory, but it was discontinued at the
South Foreland, for the cliffs there are marked by a double
light, and the electric spark was so much brighter than the
oil flames in the other house, that there was no small danger
of its being seen alone in thick weather, and thus fatally
misleading some unfortunate vessel.</p>

<p>After this Faraday made further observations, estimates
of the expense, and experiments on the divergence of the
beam, while Mr. Holmes worked away at Northfleet perfecting
his apparatus, and the authorities debated whether
it was to be exhibited again at the Start, which is a revolving
light, or at Dungeness, which is fixed. The scientific
adviser was in favour of the Start, but after an interview
with Mr. Milner Gibson, then President of the Board of
Trade, Dungeness was determined on; a beautiful small
combination of lenses and prisms was made expressly for it
by Messrs. Chance, and at last, after two years' delay, the
light again shone on our southern coast.</p>

<p>It may be well to describe the apparatus. There are 120
permanent magnets, weighing about 50 lbs. each, ranged on
the periphery of two large wheels. A steam-engine of about
three-horse power causes a series of 180 soft iron cores,
surrounded by coils of wire, to rotate past the magnets.
This calls the power into action, and the small streams of
electricity are all collected together, and by what is called
a "commutator" the alternative positive and negative currents
are brought into one direction. The whole power is
then conveyed by a thick wire from the engine-hous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>e to the
lighthouse tower, and up into the centre of the glass apparatus.
There it passes between two charcoal points, and
produces an intensely brilliant continuous spark. At sunset
the machine is started, making about 100 revolutions per
minute; and the attendant has only to draw two bolts in
the lamp, when the power thus spun in the engine-room
bursts into light of full intensity. The "lamp" regulates
itself, so as to keep the points always at a proper distance
apart, and continues to burn, needing little or no attention
for three hours and a half, when, the charcoals being consumed,
the lamp must be changed, but this is done without
extinguishing the light.</p>

<p>Again there were inspections, and reports from pilots and
other observers, and Faraday propounded lists of questions
to the engineer about bolts and screws and donkey-engines,
while he estimated that at the Varne light-ship, about equidistant
from Cape Grisnez and Dungeness, the maximum
effect of the revolving French light was equalled by the
constant gleam from the English tower. But delays again
ensued till intelligent keepers could be found and properly
instructed; but on the 6th June, 1862, Faraday's own light,
the baby grown into a giant, shone permanently on the coast
of Britain.</p>

<p>France, too, was alert. Berlioz's machine, which was
displayed at the International Exhibition in London, and
which was also examined by Faraday, was approved by the
French Government, and was soon illuminating the double
lighthouse near Havre. These magneto-electric lights on
either side of the Channel have stood the test of years; and
during the last two years there has shone another still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
beautiful one at Souter Point, near Tynemouth; while the
narrow strait between England and France is now guarded
by these "sentinels of peaceful progress," for the revolving
light at Grisnez has been lately illuminated on this principle,
and on the 1st of January, 1872, the two lights of the South
Foreland flashed forth with the electric flame.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In describing thus the valuable applications of Faraday's
discoveries of benzol, of specific inductive capacity, and
of magneto-electricity, it is not intended to exalt these
above other discoveries which as yet have paid no tribute
to the material wants of man. The good fruit borne by
other researches may not be sufficiently mature, but it
doubtless contains the seeds of many useful inventions.
Yet, after all, we must not measure the worth of Faraday's
discoveries by any standard of practical utility in the present
or in the future. His chief merit is that he enlarged
so much the boundaries of our knowledge of the physical
forces, opened up so many new realms of thought, and won
so many heights which have become the starting-points for
other explorers.</p>

<h2>SUPPLEMENTARY PORTRAITS.</h2>

<p>It has been said that there is no photograph or painting
of Faraday which is a satisfactory likeness; not because
good portraits have never been published, but because they
cannot give the varied and ever-shifting expression of his
features. Similarly, I fear that the mental portraiture which
I have attempted will fail to satisfy his intimate acquaintance.
Yet, as one who never saw him in the flesh may gain
a good idea of his personal appearance by comparing
several pictures, so the reader may learn more of his intellectual
and moral features by combining the several estimates
which have been made by different minds. Earlier
biographies have been already referred to, but my sketch
may well be supplemented by an anonymous poem that
appeared immediately after his death, and by the words of
two of the most distinguished foreign philosophers&mdash;Messrs.
De la Rive and Dumas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>The estimate of M. A. de la Rive is from a letter he
addressed to Faraday himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am grieved to hear that your brain is weary; this has
sometimes happened on former occasions, in consequence
of your numerous and persevering labours, and you will
bear in mind that a little rest is necessary to restore you.
You possess that which best contributes to peace of mind
and serenity of spirit&mdash;a full and perfect faith, a pure and
tranquil conscience, filling your heart with the glorious
hopes which the Gospel imparts. You have also the advantage
of having always led a smooth and well-regulated life,
free from ambition, and therefore exempt from all the
anxieties and drawbacks which are inseparable from it.
Honour has sought you in spite of yourself; you have
known, without despising it, how to value it at its true
worth. You have known how to gain the high esteem, and
at the same time the affection, of all those acquainted
with you.</p>

<p>"Moreover, thanks to the goodness of God, you have
not suffered any of those family misfortunes which crush
one's life. You should, therefore, watch the approach of old
age without fear and without bitterness, having the comforting
feeling that the wonders which you have been able to
decipher in the book of nature must contribute to the
greater reverence and adoration of their Supreme Author.</p>

<p>"Such, my dear friend, is the impression that your beautiful
life always leaves upon me; and when I compare it
with our troubled and ill-fulfilled life-course, with all that
accumulation of drawbacks and griefs by which mine in
particular has been attended, I put you down as very
happy, especially as you are worthy of your good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>tune.
This leads me to reflect on the miserable state of those who
are without that religious faith which you possess in so great
a degree."</p>

<p>In M. Dumas' Eloge at the Académie des Sciences,
occur the following sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not know whether there is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> who would
not feel happy in leaving behind him such works as those
with which Faraday has gladdened his contemporaries, and
which he has left as a legacy to posterity: but I am certain
that all those who have known him would wish to approach
that moral perfection which he attained to without effort.
In him it appeared to be a natural grace, which made him
a professor full of ardour for the diffusion of truth, an
indefatigable worker, full of enthusiasm and sprightliness
in his laboratory, the best and most amiable of men in the
bosom of his family, and the most enlightened preacher
amongst the humble flock whose faith he followed.</p>

<p>"The simplicity of his heart, his candour, his ardent
love of the truth, his fellow-interest in all the successes,
and ingenuous admiration of all the discoveries of others,
his natural modesty in regard to what he himself discovered,
his noble soul&mdash;independent and bold,&mdash;all these combined
gave an incomparable charm to the features of the illustrious
physicist.</p>

<p>"I have never known a man more worthy of being
loved, of being admired, of being mourned.</p>

<p>"Fidelity to his religious faith, and the constant observance
of the moral law, constitute the ruling characteristics
of his life. Doubtless his firm belief in that justice on high
which weighs all our merits, in that sovereign goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
which weighs all our sufferings, did not inspire Faraday
with his great discoveries, but it gave him the straightforwardness,
the self-respect, the self-control, and the spirit
of justice, which enabled him to combat evil fortune with
boldness, and to accept prosperity without being puffed
up....</p>

<p>"There was nothing dramatic in the life of Faraday. It
should be presented under that simplicity of aspect which
is the grandeur of it. There is, however, more than one
useful lesson to be learnt from the proper study of this
illustrious man, whose youth endured poverty with dignity,
whose mature age bore honours with moderation, and
whose last years have just passed gently away surrounded
by marks of respect and tender affection."</p>

account books, and various memoranda, together with letters

lectures, when one day, the Professor being absent, his assistant took
his place, and lectured with so much ease that he won the complete
approval of the audience. This, he said, was Faraday's first lecture
at the Royal Institution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The laboratory note-book shows that at this very time he was making

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The following anecdote has been sent me on the authority of Mr.
Benjamin Abbott:&mdash;"Sergeant Anderson was engaged to attend to the
furnaces in Mr. Faraday's researches on optical glass in 1828, and was
chosen simply because of the habits of strict obedience his military
training had given him. His duty was to keep the furnaces always at
the same heat, and the water in the ashpit always at the same level. In
the evening he was released, but one night Faraday forgot to tell
Anderson he could go home, and early next morning he found his faithful
servant still stoking the glowing furnace, as he had been doing
all night long." A more probable and better authenticated version
of this story is that after nightfall Anderson went upstairs to Faraday,
who was already in bed, to inquire if he was to remain still on duty.</p></div>

Study of the English Language," he mentioned as a common vulgarism
that of using "don't" in the third person singular, as "He don't pay
his debts." Faraday exclaimed aloud, "That's very wrong."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Since the publication of the first edition I have been struck with
how precisely his practice corresponded with his precept in the introduction
to his book on "Chemical Manipulation:"&mdash;"When an experiment
has been devised, its general nature and principles arranged in the
mind, and the causes to be brought into action, with the effect to be
expected, properly considered, then it has to be performed. The ultimate
objects of an experiment, and also the particular contrivance or
mode by which the results are to be produced, being mental, there
remains the mere performance of it, which may properly enough be
expressed by the term <em>manipulation</em>.
</p>
<p>
"Notwithstanding this subordinate character of manipulation, it is
yet of high importance in an experimental science, and particularly in
chemistry. The person who could devise only, without knowing how
to perform, would not be able to extend his knowledge far, or make it
useful; and where every doubt or question that arises in the mind is best
answered by the result of an experiment, whatever enables the philosopher
to perform the experiment in the simplest, quickest, and most direct
manner, cannot but be esteemed by him as of the utmost value."</p></div>

unsavoury ooze.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Since writing the above I have come across a letter written by
Faraday in answer to one by Captain Welier as far back as 13th Sept.
1839, in which he pointed out the mal-adjustment of the dioptric apparatus
at Orfordness. In July of the following year he made lengthy
suggestions to the Trinity House, in which he proposed using a flat
white circle or square, half an inch across, on a piece of black paper or
card, as a "focal object." This was to be looked at from outside, in
order to test the regularity of the glass apparatus. He also suggested
observations on the divergence by looking at this white circle at a distance
of twenty feet at most. Another plan he proposed was that of
lighting the lamp and putting up a white screen outside. These methods
of examining he carried out very shortly afterwards at Blackwall, on
French and English refractors, but it seems never to have occurred to
him to place his eye in the focus, or in any other manner to observe the
course of the rays from inside the apparatus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> A good instance of his caution in drawing conclusions is contained
in one of his letters to me:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="rightalign">"<span class="smcap">Royal Institution of Great Britain</span>,</p>
<p class="rightalignindent4">"<em>2 July, 1859</em>.</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Gladstone</span>,</p>
<p>
"Although I have frequently observed lights from the sea, the
only thing I have learnt in relation to their <em>relative brilliancy</em> is that
the average of a very great number of observations would be required
for the attainment of a moderate approximation to truth. One has to
be some miles off at sea, or else the observation is not made in the
chief ray, and then one does not know the state of the atmosphere about
a given lighthouse. Strong lights like that of Cape Grisnez have been
invisible when they should have been strong; feeble lights by comparison
have risen up in force when one might have expected them to be
relatively weak; and after inquiry has not shown a state of the air at
the lighthouse explaining such differences. It is probable that the
cause of difference often exists at sea.
</p>
<p>
"Besides these difficulties there is that other great one of not seeing
the two lights to be compared in the field of view at the same time
and same distance. If the eye has to turn 90° from one to the other,
I have no confidence in the comparison; and if both be in the field
of sight at once, still unexpected and unexplained causes of difference
occur. The two lights at the South Foreland are beautifully situated
for comparison, and yet sometimes the upper did not equal the lower
when it ought to have surpassed it. This I referred at the time to
an upper stratum of haze; but on shore they knew nothing of the
kind, nor had any such or other reason to expect particular effects.
</p>
<p class="rightalignindent4">"Ever truly yours,</p>
<p class="rightalignindent1">"<span class="smcap">M. Faraday</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As an instance of his unwillingness to commit himself to an opinion
unless he was sure about it, may be cited a letter he wrote to Sir G. B.
Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who asked for his advice in regard to the
material of which the national standard of length should be made:&mdash;"I
do not see any reason why a pure metal should be particularly
free from internal change of its particles, and on the whole should
rather incline to the hard alloy than to soft copper, and yet I hardly
know why. I suppose the labour would be too great to lay down the
standard on different metals and substances; and yet the comparison
of them might be very important hereafter, for twenty years seem
to <em>do</em> or <em>tell</em> a great deal in relation to standard measures." Bronze
was finally chosen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> De la Rive points this out in his brief notice of Faraday immediately
on receiving the news of his death:&mdash;"Je n'ai parlé que du
savant, je tiens aussi à dire un mot de l'homme. Alliant à une modestie
vraie, parcequ'elle provenait de l'élévation de son âme, une droiture à
toute épreuve et une candeur admirable, Faraday n'aimait la science que
pour elle-même. Aussi jouissait-il des succès des autres au moins autant
que des siens propres; et quant à lui, s'il a accepté, avec une sincère
satisfaction, les honneurs scientifiques qui lui out été prodigués à si
juste titre, il a constamment refusé toutes les autres distinctions et les
récompenses qu'on eût voulu lui décerner. Il s'est contenté toute sa vie
de la position relativement modeste qu'il occupait à l'Institution Royale
de Londres; avoir son laboratoire et strictement de quoi vivre, c'est
tout ce qu'il lui fallait.&mdash;Presinge, le 29 août, 1867.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. de la Rive.</span>"</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> One night there was a beautiful aurora. Mr. Holmes remarked
that his poor electric light could not compare with that for beauty; but
Faraday rejoined, "Don't abuse your light. The aurora is very beautiful,

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The illuminating apparatus at Dungeness is one of what is termed
the sixth order, 300 millimetres (about 12 inches) in diameter. Mr.
Chance constructed one for Souter Point of the third order, one metre
(nearly 40 inches) in diameter, with special arrangements for giving artificial
divergence to the beam in a vertical direction, in order to obviate
the danger arising from the luminous point not being always precisely in
the same spot. It has also additional contrivances for utilizing the back
light. Similar arrangements were made for the South Foreland lights,
which are also of the third order; and every portion of the machinery
and apparatus is in duplicate in case of accident, and the double force
can be employed in times of fog.</p></div>

<h3>MACMILLAN'S GLOBE LIBRARY.</h3>

<p class="ad0"><em>Beautifully printed on toned paper and bound in cloth extra, gilt
edges, price 4s. 6d. each; in cloth plain, 3s. 6d. Also kept in a
variety of calf and morocco bindings at moderate prices.</em></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">"the spirit breathed</div>
<div class="verse">By dead men to their kind;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and the aim of the publishers of the Globe Library has
been to make it possible for the universal kin of English-speaking
men to hold communion with the loftiest "spirits
of the mighty dead;" to put within the reach of all classes
<em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> editions, carefully and clearly printed
upon the best paper, in a convenient form, at a moderate
price, of the works of the <span class="smcap">master-minds of English
Literature</span>, and occasionally of foreign literature in an
attractive English dress.</p>

<p>The Editors, by their scholarship and special study of
their authors, are competent to afford every assistance to
readers of all kinds: this assistance is rendered by original
biographies, glossaries of unusual or obsolete words, and
critical and explanatory notes.</p>

<p>The publishers hope, therefore, that these Globe Editions
may prove worthy of acceptance by all classes wherever the
English Language is spoken, and by their universal circulation
justify their distinctive epithet; while at the same time
they spread and nourish a common sympathy with nature's
most "finely touched" spirits, and thus help a little to
"make the whole world kin."</p>

<p class="ad2"><em>The <span class="smcap fontnormal">Saturday Review</span> says:</em> "<em>The Globe Editions are admirable
for their scholarly editing, their typographical excellence, their compendious
form, and their cheapness.</em>" <em>The <span class="smcap fontnormal">British Quarterly
Review</span> says:</em> "<em>In compendiousness, elegance, and scholarliness,
the Globe Editions of Messrs. Macmillan surpass any popular series
of our classics hitherto given to the public. As near an approach

<em>And the <span class="smcap fontnormal">Pall Mall Gazette</span> observes:</em> "<em>To have produced
